    "content": "Into the Breach, Subset Games' tiny tactics game about mechs fighting bugs across continents and timelines, was a treat and one of the few games I could run on my non-gaming laptop when it came out in 2018. Its core gameplay loop was gloriously simple, but endlessly replayable, as you unlocked new teams of mechs with fresh abilities and the roguelike gameplay randomized the encounters you faced on each new run. With Bug Hunter in UFO 50 — the second game released by the fictional company UFO Soft — developer mossmouth has, somehow, simplified Into the Breach further. The influence is unmistakable. Though you no longer control mechs, your space soldier is still fighting a war against giant bugs. UFO 50 makes me feel like a kid again. The abilities at your disposal are straight out of Into the Breach, too. You can hit your insectoid enemies with lasers from afar, or push them into chasms, dispatching them instantly. Over the course of a match, the bugs will evolve, becoming more powerful and/or tougher to kill. Eventually, they'll turn into eggs. At that point, if you don't kill them by the end of the turn, they'll hatch, filling the screen with bugs and ending your run. As with Into the Breach, you often know exactly what's about to happen; the challenge is in stopping it. Energy pellets are scattered around the battlefield and they're one of the big shifts away from Into the Breach. Instead of having a set amount of moves that never changes, every time you collect two energy pellets, you have the option to buy a new ability. That can be an attack or a move, so you have to think carefully about how it will work in concert with the other skills in your roster. Once you purchase it, that ability occupies that slot going forward, so while you might want to swap your spent move ability instead of a fresh attack, you might need the move more in the next round. It's delightfully complex and tough-as-nails — certainly tougher out the gate than Into the Breach — and demands constant trade-offs. So far, I've only made it past the first round once. There's so much to manage. The eggs on the board, which will end your turn if they hatch; the amount of enemies you need to kill to finish the round; the number of turns you have left to kill them. And little things that you ignore one round become big things that kill you the next. It can be a bit overwhelming but, well, that's kind of UFO 50's whole thing. This is a game that gives you 50 full games right off the bat. As the Steam page stresses, \"these are NOT minigames or microgames! Although the size of each game varies, every one is a complete experience, from its opening title screen to its ending credits.\" Bug Hunter feels complex because it's just one of 50 games that I got all at once for 25 bucks. If this was a standalone game, it might seem too simple to buy on its own. But as 1/50th of a collection, it feels wildly ambitious. Into the Breach was always good, but it's tactical perfection on a phone screen. We want to hear from you! Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful.

Thomas Mahler is right about rejecting consultants, but he's not talking about the same types the base he's appealing to are Max Caulfield deserves more than to have her life still revolve around someone that didn’t treat her well. No laughing at the rude clues in today's Connections, please No, this unfinished sequel isn’t worthy of Game of the Year Riven offers such an immersive experience in virtual reality that you might forget about those bagels you left in the oven.",

    "source_url": "https://www.thegamer.com/tag/indie-games/",
    "content": "I gasped, I blushed, I groaned, and I laughed out loud. Building Relationships is the weirdest, funniest game I’ve played in a while, and I need more right now. While the dating sim didn’t have its own booth at Gamescom Asia, I met Building Relationship’s sole developer Tanat Boozayaangool after a panel I’d given about expanding global media attention for Southeast Asian games where I’d talked for several minutes about how much I love well-formatted cold emails with proper press kits. He sent me a message saying “hello how do I cold email you irl (tanat).” Later, at an afterparty, he gave me a sticker sheet that had text like “Can I feel your load-bearing walls?” and “will you use my back door” superimposed over various building structures. You can extrapolate Building Relationship’s entire vibe from this information. Yes, it’s wild. I went home and played the demo that weekend, which was available as part of Steam Next Fest. October 2024. Steam Next Fest. Best demos. You're in the right place. I’m not really into dating sims unless they’re weird in some major way, and Building Relationships is exactly that. For one, you’re not a person, but a house, and you’re trying to date other houses, or Bachelorx Pads. The demo has you rolling around (you don’t have legs, you’re a house) an island full of other houses who might be here with their partners, or are single and very down to mingle. You’ll find other houses scattered around the island. Some may be Bachelorx Pads, who will hit on you very aggressively – I’m no prude, but I found myself blushing at their forwardness, then laughing at the extended tight shots of each building that somehow, incredibly, demonstrated sexual tension between two inanimate objects. Some may be Chesters, chests that conduct community surveys. One asked me if I was a top or a bottom, which made me bury my face in my hands despite the fact that nobody was around to see my answer. Another, hiding in a field, bemoaned being burnt out, and honestly, aren’t we all? Still more structures will offer you gifts that give you new skills. I received two satellite dishes, allowing me to jump and double-jump, and I was very pleased to discover that each leap was punctuated with a little ‘honk’ sound that at times harmonised with the game’s chirpy background music. Another gift allowed me to dash, which meant I could jump off the edge of a cliff and fling my house violently across the map. What a treat. There are some light platforming elements to the game in that you can collect coins around the island, and some may be in places that are tricky to reach without some precise jumping. I even got a fishing rod, because absurdly, you can fish in Building Relationships. Except you’re not actually catching fish, but underwater cars. It’s so stupid. I love it. It would be so easy for Building Relationships to stray into the realm of the gratuitous or irony-pilled, but the humour feels spot on in its absurdity. From the bizarre puns hinting at sexual innuendo to the hilariously relatable dialogue, it all just works. One house said they didn’t know how to tell their partner that they “HATE bouldering”, which I definitely get. And I laughed out loud when my pal Mint said they’d cleared a path for me, and when I asked how, responded, “Haha I shot it with a gun.” Perhaps my favourite thing about the demo was how it closed. I went to a picnic to meet the other Bachelorx Pads, but bumped into Mint at the entrance where they told me that we needed food, and I’d have to cook some with the ingredients they had. These ingredients turned out to be parts of a table, and cooking meant building the furniture. I love building Ikea furniture, because I’m a sicko, so referring to the instructions and flopping the components around with the game’s janky physics was a treat. I love Building Relationships. I want to build more relationships, and also more Ikea furniture. You can wishlist it now on Steam. As the new arrival to the island, you're here to meet eligible bachelorx pads and find the love of your life! Enjoy a one-of-a-kind story as you navigate a bizarre dating adventure amongst a unique set of structures. Uncover hidden secrets! A variety of biomes across an island, jam-packed with goodies! Search through a somber forest, climb up a snowy mountain, or just lay in a flowery field. Realistic building movement! We always thought \"the one thing missing from dating sims is the ability to wave-dash\". So we added it! Go on a date! Looking to shack up? Meet structures like Millie (a windmill who might step on you if you ask nicely) or Tenet (who's just a himbo tent). Or go fishing instead?

    "content": "Developer Zockrates Laboratories UG • Publisher Phiphen Games • Release April 2025 • Platforms PS, Xbox, Switch, PC Platformers usually ask players “How can you overcome this obstacle?”. Ruffy and the Riverside changes the question by asking “What if you could change the obstacle itself?” Its unique texture-swapping mechanic offers an eyebrow-raising answer. After sitting down with the game’s Steam demo, I walked away largely impressed with this promising twist on the 3D platformers of yesteryear. Ruffy is a cheery bear plastered with a smile wide enough for a plane to fly through. His real talent is the magical power to copy textures – grass, water, or sand, for example – and paste them onto a different surface. Copying and pasting climbing vines onto a waterfall turns it into a climbable surface. Toying with this feature becomes fun in an instant. I once copied sand and pasted it onto a river, turning it into a flowing path of quicksand. I know it’s quicksand because I eagerly jumped in and sank to my death. While good for platforming, clever traversal puzzles use texture-swapping to its fullest. To scale a series of tall stone columns standing in the middle of an ocean, I needed to make them lower to jump atop them. First, I copied a wood texture and applied it to the columns’ bottom stacks. Next, I copied a lava texture from a nearby erupting volcano and slapped it on the water. With the ocean now a molten sea, the columns’ now wooden foundations burned into ashes, causing them to sink low enough for me to leap on. The game shines brightest when it encourages this type of out-of-the-box thinking. Whether it’s changing a wall painting’s pattern to unlock a key or rearranging tiles to solve a riddle, I’m impressed with the different puzzle variations presented so far. However, my enthusiasm to swap anything and everything was dampened by the fact that only certain textures can be applied to specific objects. The game told me “no” more often than I expected or wanted, which was a bit of a bummer. Ruffy falls into the collect-a-thon genre of 3D platformers ala Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie. A main overworld features small challenges that reward stars; collecting enough unlocks platforming levels laden with them. The platforming stages are pretty textbook; texture swapping spices up the otherwise routine jumping around. That doesn’t mean that’s all players will do. I had a good time in one stage that ditched platforming in favor of what’s essentially a skateboard competition, except Ruffy rides atop a giant ball of hay. Developer Zockrates Labs has something special in Ruffy and the Riverside‘s main hook. It’s a novel way to interact with the world, and I’m excited to see how puzzle-solving evolves throughout the full adventure. The platforming feels good, and I dig the Paper Mario-esque art direction; every character looks like a vibrant marker drawing cut out of a notebook. If all goes well, we may be pasting Ruffy and the Riverside on the list of indie gems for 2025.",

    "content": "Developer YCJY Games • Publisher YCJY Games • Release February 6 • Reviewed On PC Is it possible to feel nostalgia for a zeitgeist you never experienced — that may never have really existed at all? Though Keep Driving is thoroughly European, the road trip is a venerated concept in car-centric American culture. Route 66, drive-ins, and the silver screen all harken back to a time when the open road meant freedom. While I didn’t live through any of this in its heyday (and considering it has come down to me via advertisements and media with particular motives for painting the pavement like a picturesque scene the reality is questionable) there’s still a piece of me ready for that promised adventure. Keep Driving taps into the road trip fantasy and delivers a game where the journey truly is the destination. It’s not all carefree, with a host of problems from stubborn sheep to potholes to contend with, but the unique sense of choice, replayability, and branching narrative manifest the promise in its title. I can’t stop driving. It’s not listed among the game’s various genre tags, but Keep Driving most closely resembles a rogue-lite. Though its other listed categories (including Adventure, Simulation, and RPG), are also key pillars. A “run” — though in this game it might be more thematic to call it a drive — begins at home. I step out of my house as a teenager with a free summer, the open road, and a letter in front of me. Inside the envelope is an invitation to a music festival clear across the map. Looking over my beat-up sedan, I wonder if the thing will actually hold up over so long a distance. It won’t be long until my poor wheels are tested. The gameplay consists of two parts: Braving a stretch of plotted-out highway and recovering in an automobile oasis before setting out again. While on the road, a variety of events await. Most of them will test my car, body, and wallet. One of the first hurdles I have to navigate is a slow-moving truck. The difficulties aren’t played out in real-time action, rather they are represented by various icons on your dash. Little green figures indicate an impending threat to your stamina. Blue dots are a challenge to your vehicle’s stability. And there are icons for things like money and gas as well. In a turn-based battle for good vibes, I have to use skills that correspond to the correct threat, neutralizing it. If I’ve used up all my skills or just haven’t unlocked the proper one to combat a particular danger, I take a hit. If the damaging threat was a gas icon, my actual gas gauge ticks down. Now, I have that much less in my tank to take me to the next stop on my map. If I completely run out of gas — or my car’s durability drops to zero, or my body’s energy depletes, etc. — I face the realistic consequences. Several times throughout my four-hour first run, I found myself stranded on the highway. The game offers tenuous lifelines to get back on track. If I have money or energy left, I may be able to sacrifice them to get back to my last checkpoint. However, my most harrowing brush with defeat made me resort to calling my parents for help — something which, for me, had only about a forty percent chance of working out. The road also offers introspection and friendships. As I zoom along, I get to thinking about life’s larger problems, like whether I could down an entire bottle of liquor and still be good to drive. Or whether nature holds inspiration or dread. In the first case, my confidence resulted in a bottle appearing in my trunk (I sold it for some quick cash at the first convenience store I came across). My favorable view of the forest, however, changed my stats, giving me a buff when cruising through wooded areas. Sometimes, I was hailed by someone in need on the side of the road. The characters had a wide range of backgrounds, goals, and skill sets. The first hitchhiker I picked up was a punk rocker with a dog hoping to make it to a major town for a show. This gave me a new side quest which enriched my experience. His back-and-forth dialogue about the nature of humanity filled the hours as the scenery flew by. He and his canine companion also helpfully lent me their skills during road events, noticeably changing up my combat strategy. All of these combined meant that — even though I was essentially doing the same thing — no stretch of road ever felt the same. Unique rewards, thoughts, and challenges accompanied each. The urge to see what waited just around the next bend makes the game extremely hard to put down. Then there’s phase two: The stops. Successfully arriving at my next destination meant gaining experience for what I’d overcome, a chance to stretch my legs, and resupply. My experience points allow me to unlock increasingly useful combinations of skills from my skill tree. It also threw some tricky planning at me, as I often didn’t have enough money to completely refuel, fix my battered car, soothe my aching body, and grab snacks or helpful items for my next adventure. Often in Keep Driving, I would pour what resources I had into fueling my next leg of the trip before taking off again, hoping for good luck on the road. Keeping everything running smoothly could be a stressful pursuit, but the unpredictable events, hazardous challenges, and stimulating connections kept my hands firmly on the steering wheel.",

    "content": "Developer Soft Not Weak • Publisher Soft Not Weak • Release February 3 • Played On PC Match-3 games, when done right, excel at lulling players into a zen-like state of puzzle-swapping bliss. Spirit Swap: Lofi Beats to Match-3 To captures nirvana and layers on a lofi soundtrack, charming visuals, and a comforting vibe to its action. Though the package is sparse with a narrative element that doesn’t grab me, the core gameplay should attract anyone who uses puzzle games to decompress and zone out. Fans of the SNES cult classic Panel de Pon, perhaps better known in the West as Tetris Attack, should feel right at home in Spirit Swap. Unlike traditional Tetris, players can only swap two tiles horizontally to line up three matching symbols to clear them from the ever-rising board. Hanging tiles can also strategically plummet into open spaces below. Thanks to Panel de Pon’s arrival to Nintendo Switch Online, I became a big (and late) fan, so I was eager to try Spirit Swap’s modernized spin on the formula. Spirit Swap plays identically to Panel De Pon but adds fun wrinkles in the form of board-clearing spells. These special powers activate depending on how tiles are arranged. A matching 2×2 square-shaped pattern can clear several topmost rows. A cross shape can clear all tiles within each of its cardinal directions. Equipping up to three spells at a time from a growing pool of them adds a thoughtful preamble to starting a round, and they’re obtained by completing the game’s story campaign. I don’t need a narrative hook to enjoy a good Match-3 game, and Spirit Swap’s charming but flat tale doesn’t change my mind. As the witch Samar, you’ll stop invading spirits by playing competitive best-of-three puzzle battles against her fantastical (and beautifully illustrated) friend circle while lending an ear to their personal plights. Whether it’s comforting Samar’s BFF after a breakup or cultivating a romance with a cool skater boi, spending time with folks raises Samar’s bond with them. Deepend relationships reward new spells and a small selection of new decor, such as plushies or a froggy rug, to jazz up her customizable bedroom. It’s the lightest take on systems like Persona’s Social Links and Animal Crossing’s Happy Home Designer. Combined with a thin narrative, the campaign feels more like a garnish to the core gameplay than a meaningful destination. I’m not the biggest home decor guy, and Samar and Co. seem lovely, but I wanted to skip through their dialogue to jump quickly to the next round of puzzle swapping. Perhaps that’s a testament to the strength of the versus matches, where players swap furiously while sabotaging each other by sending obstructing trash blocks. As such, most of my time with Spriit Swap has been spent testing my skills in its Endless Mode. I swapped my heart’s content under various settings, such as adjusting the tile speed and overall difficulty. I appreciate how these options allow Spriit Swap to be as relaxed or intense as players prefer. Spirit Swap nails its relaxing vibe as effectively as its match-3 gameplay. The vibrant art direction makes it easy on the eyes while its enjoyable lofi soundtrack calms the nerves. Perhaps the best compliment I can give is I’ve already burned through a couple of podcasts while lining up its whimsical tiles. When I’m looking to ease my nerves with a good puzzler, I’m happy that Spirit Swap will have my back.",

    "content": "Developer Jump Over The Age • Publisher Fellow Traveller • Release January 31 • Reviewed On PC “Because you are a broken thing, and you have nothing left but that brokenness, and the beauty that shines through it.” Two hundred and forty-three cycles after my desperate, amnesiac escape, I wait for it all to end. To end, and, hopefully, begin anew. Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector is a masterwork. Starting at the end seems fitting for this sequel, which is rife with musings on the nature of time — perhaps inspired directly by Citizen Sleeper 2’s place as the end of the franchise. At the title’s conclusion, I, the player, become the Sleeper — the game’s humanly hero — brilliantly. Turning off the game after the credits roll is like putting myself in suspended animation with the looming possibility of a new adventure. If I’m not too afraid to succumb to hope, I myself can mimic the protagonist’s journey. Injecting real life with a game’s reality, influencing me to experience the character’s doubts as I decide whether to start over from scratch or hold on to my lived memories, is a gift few developers can give. As for the journey itself, Citizen Sleeper 2 is a tabletop role-playing game made virtual. Six-sided dice control my success or failure for almost every action. This includes everything from discovering where in town to buy supplies to whether I earn a day’s wage or even whether I can navigate danger unscathed. Every scenario plays out via the most skillfully and subtly woven descriptions draping embellishments across the screen. The text conjures the smallest details of a gesture and the vastness of the cosmic landscape in my mind without needing to picture it on screen. The writing, simply put, is phenomenal. Successfully punching my way through a tough spot or gliding out of peril on the tip of my silver tongue depends on my stats, and, more broadly, which class I picked at the beginning of the game. An operator’s skill, for example, is tailored for interfacing but has absolutely no aptitude for endurance. This can be a problem when I face an obstacle that demands brute strength and leaves me at the mercy of the dice. But even in the best circumstances, things can always go bad. Unlike the previous title, Citizen Sleeper 2 encourages me to gather a rag-tag crew on my spaceship, which I can bring out with me on various celestial missions. So, I quickly move to recruit a character with a little brawn. It seems like my problems are solved after that, but the game throws another curveball at me: Stress. Stress accrues out in the vast reaches of space when skill checks go awry. When my crew members get overwhelmed, they dip out of the mission, dramatically cutting down my chance at success. With each stress level I gained, I increased the chance that one of my five D6s would break — that’s right, completely shatter and become useless for the foreseeable future. I might also find myself glitch-infested, transforming one of my dice. After glitching, that die would only have a twenty percent chance of success no matter what. You have to be desperate to use them, and I definitely got desperate before the end. With these new elements, the sequel offers more movement, strategy, connection, and risk. Committing to a course, contending with corroded edges and struggling to survive, is exhilarating. Failure is unavoidable, but reality’s harshness makes the moments of empathy and humanity glimmer brighter. Mechanically, the game is great at spurring pressure, inducing movement, and prompting carefulness. The clock is always ticking. I’m constantly being hunted, and staying on one planet too long ensures capture. There never seems to be enough fuel, cyro (currency), or supplies to flee comfortably. It doesn’t help that every locale harbors people in need, tempting opportunities, and waylaying plot points. However, the tension is doled out in meticulously measured doses. Whatever the outcome, it’s never so harsh that I want to quit. Sometimes – most times – things simply don’t work out the way I anticipated and there are very few easy choices. Everything involves strings, compromises, and uncertainties. But choosing to do the best with what I have feels more like a badge of honor than a failing. Succeeding feels like a triumph. Citizen Sleeper 2 is phenomenal, evocative, and haunting. The minimal visuals are flawlessly supported by the writing. Gut-wrenching expressions and touchingly lonely scenes flow out of the masterful descriptions. The audio design had me rocketing from dawning dread to heart-pumping motivation. And in the end, I was forced into the hero’s dilemma in a way that cemented this game as one of the year’s best.",

    "content": "Developer Yellow Brick Games • Publisher Yellow Brick Games • Release January 28 • Played On PC An Ashpeak Drake is attacking, and Brynn needs to get to higher ground. An incoming fireball shakes the tower, shattering crates and a bookshelf leaning against its stone walls. The wooden staircase is missing a flight, so Brynn uses magic to construct a crude bridge of ice to close the gap. Finally, she reaches the building’s summit and is greeted by the night sky and the glare of a snarling, draconic beast. As it rears back to unleash another blast of fire, Brynn uses the last of her magic to crust the creature’s wings with ice. As it spirals to the earth below, she leaps onto its back, slashing at it the whole way down. This isn’t the description of a cutscene, quick-time event, or scripted boss fight – it’s an organic encounter I had with an enemy just a few hours into Eternal Strands. Its thoughtfully crafted physics systems and magic abilities make for a dynamic world that’s fun and complex, even in the earliest hours. Eternal Strands is the debut title from Yellow Brick Games, an independent developer founded by a team of AAA veterans, including people who worked on beloved series like Dragon Age and Assassin’s Creed. Their first project is a third-person action title that stars Brynn, a magic-wielding adventurer exploring the ruins of an enchanting world. The titular Strands are the source of Brynn’s magic. Each one allows her to interact with the world in fantastical ways, and you’re encouraged to use them liberally. You start with two: Weaver’s Grasp and Ice Wall. The former is essentially The Force – you can pick up most enemies and objects and toss them around dealing significant damage and clearing paths. Meanwhile, Ice Wall generates clusters of ice wherever you point, allowing you to draw shapes to put out fires or freeze enemies in place. These tools are incredibly intuitive in ways video games don’t always account for. Ice Wall, for instance, can obviously create walls of ice, but it can also freeze body parts of huge enemies, either keeping them stuck in place or temporarily disabling certain limbs. Freezing the wings of a Drake causes it to struggle to fly and crash to the ground. Freezing the foot of a giant ark, a magical colossus, keeps it stationary for long enough to climb on its back. Climbing is not limited to combat – Eternal Strands allows players to climb on virtually any vertical surface. Brynn is limited by her stamina meter, but it’s very generous at the game’s opening, and I rarely lacked the stamina to get where I wanted to go. The world is broken up into a series of open areas the player can travel between, so while the story is linear, the player is encouraged to explore. Between the climbing system and magical traversal techniques, that exploration feels great. Brynn defends herself with an array of weapons in combat, including a sword and shield, a bow, and a large two-handed blade that she can switch between on the fly. Combat feels good, complete with parries, dodge rolls, and a stamina meter, but you’ll almost always need to complement sword swings with spells. Many enemies automatically dodge arrows, so you need an Ice Wall to keep them in one spot. It’s also often more useful to throw one enemy into another with Weaver’s Grasp since it knocks both to the ground and gives Brynn room to breathe. I love this design choice; it makes combat cinematic and exciting while clearly distinguishing it from other fantasy-themed action titles. Brynn’s equipment, including armor, can be forged and improved through the game’s crafting systems, which I returned to frequently. Between monster drops and destructible items in the environment, you can collect a wide variety of materials, and they’re sorted into a handful of wide categories. For example, “carved resources” include wood and some types of stone, while “forged resources” encompasses ores and metals. Instead of calling for specific materials, a crafting recipe only requires items from the category; instead of asking for five pieces of iron, it just needs five pieces of any forged resource. The specific resources affect the appearance and the stats, so a bow made with softwood is weaker and lighter in color than a bow made with ironwood. This ultimately means you can craft virtually any item as soon as you get the recipe. But you’re also heavily rewarded for exploring the world to get specific resources to customize the gear to your preferred colors and stats. I spent a good amount of my playtime hunting around for green materials (my favorite color), but a more strategic player may hunt for items that would make their armor resistant to cold or fire damage. Eternal Stands’ combat encounters and resource collection occur on expeditions Brynn can embark on three times a day. Between these trips, she spends time back at the home base with the rest of her adventuring crew. While I find the supporting characters at least a little endearing, the story itself is not particularly interesting. Between a general lack of conflict between characters, the absence of a specific antagonist, and dialogue laden with exposition and proper nouns, I relied on the gameplay loop to keep me invested, not the story. This might change later in the game, but not in the first four hours. That said, I am engaged with the storytelling in Eternal Stands, but it’s the story of my adventures exploring the world. When you give a player an exciting toolbox and drop them in environments designed to react to those tools in multitudes of ways, it creates countless unique, organic stories, like the perilous Ashpeak Drake encounter I recounted at the top of this piece. I can’t wait to hear other players’ stories when they get their hands on this game, and I can’t wait to dive back in to make more of my own.",

    "content": "Developer The Game Kitchen • Publisher Tripwire Presents • Release January 28 • Played On PC My mind is split in two — which thematically works pretty well for The Stone of Madness, the new game from the creators behind the Blasphemous franchise. Its animated cutscenes manifest movement and personality, harkening back to works like Dragon’s Liar or The Sword in the Stone. However, the irresistible style is, unsurprisingly from The Game Kitchen, shaded quite a bit darker here. The gameplay loop also looks back in time for its genre: Strategic stealth, which I’ve long been a fan of and have seen increasingly fewer examples. I’m perfectly content to lurk in the shadows clocking patrol routines and plotting out possible infiltration routes. It is intensely hard to put down even before weighing in the pull of the historical setting and clandestine plot. So why am I of two minds if the gameplay is absorbing and the worldbuilding is captivating? It’s almost like two unrelated teams worked on each part and at no point communicated with the other. The bizarre stitching of two aspects has left me baffled, though I still find the game hard to put down. I’ve put eight hours into The Stone of Madness so far. Honestly, I suspect I’ll finish it, partly because it’s an excellent Steam Deck experience and podcast game. It does have a day/night cycle, but time isn’t an enemy. Rather it’s a currency I spend to gather knowledge before enacting — what I hope is — my perfectly laid plans. For those who may not be familiar with the game, I wrote a preview you can check out. As a quick summary, players control a group of deeply flawed inmates in an eighteenth-century monastery’s insanity ward. Indeed, each individual has their struggles, including an unmanageable fear of fire or the dark, which makes my tasks even more difficult. However, they also boast essential skills, like lockpicking or spellweaving. This merry band comes together after the mysterious death of a fellow inmate, revealing a conspiracy surrounding a supernatural stone. I played out finding this woman and discovering the stone over a three-hour prologue. During that time I had tutorials, like you’d expect, and built up my team’s synergies and resources. In the end, I was given a choice that promised to drastically change the game’s narrative path. What it also drastically changed was my opinion. After picking my path, the game seemed to have started all over again in a way. The tutorials came back as if I’d never seen them, all of my hard-earned loot was inexplicably gone, and the narrative became unignorably disjointed. The opening cutscene made it seem as though I had, in the past, collected a crew and brought them all into my base. Even after the prologue, though, it still seemed like my teammates hadn’t officially joined in my cause and I still had to get everyone together. It was like the narrative and gameplay were there, it was just no one had a vision for melding the two coherently. Confused, I moved on seeking to unravel the mystery at The Stone of Madness‘ heart. The inconsistencies have yet to resolve themselves, but the gameplay and world maintain their iron grip on me even hours later. Maybe the game’s dazzling disparate pieces will blend as I reach its conclusion. At least I hope, lest I join the characters in their disoriented prison.",

    "content": "Developer Odd Bug Studio • Publisher United Label • Janurary 28 • Reviewed On PC With smoke from the war — replete with losses, twists, and triumphs — still hanging in the air, I was excited to head back into Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter‘s world. The exploration, level design, and discoverable rewards are the game’s highest gameplay peaks. The difficulty is I spent so much time in the game’s lowest gameplay valleys. The combination of limited saving and battles that demand a little more than the controls allow is a frustrating blow to my soul. A beautiful medieval, hand-drawn fantasy cataloging the intrigues of the Ratdom, Tails of Iron 2 begins with a royal bastard and undead nightmares awakening. The narrative pulls me from comfortable sheets to the destruction of all I’ve ever known. I feel the weight of unexpected responsibility. I’m unprepared and unequipped to rebuild my crumbled world, but my burning rage pushes me to revenge. It’s undeniably intriguing that Tails of Iron 2’s combat requires brain as much as brawn. Enemies’ color-coded moves indicate whether I should dodge, parry, or shield to survive the onslaught unscathed. When it all comes together, I feel wildly skilled — like I fought through fire and emerged tempered steel. Unfortunately, these mechanics require just a little more than the controls allow. The movement doesn’t flow like a Dead Cells or Nine Sols, it’s much more weighted. This means dodging is uncertain, parry timing isn’t precise, and the shield takes a fraction too long to rise to my defense. The frustrations compound with the game’s antiquated saving. Namely, there’s no autosave. This culminated in what, for me, was one of the most maddening gaming moments I’ve experienced in recent memory. Having taken on a harsh, two-phase boss battle multiple times, I slowly mastered the timing for each of my foe’s moves. Even then – with tools like exploding traps, element-based magic, and damaging-increasing whetstones – it was a bitter battle to snatch an eventual victory. Out of healing and with only a sliver of health to my name, I rescue a captured cohort of rodents before heading back to the save point located in the next room over. Unfortunately, a series of elevated ramps separated me from this goal and, before reaching the save, I slipped off one. The damage from falling ten feet was enough to wipe the rest of my health. I respawned with all my hard work undone, with the boss waiting for me once more. I saw red. I cursed. I thought of never playing again. But, to give credit to the devs, they offer a great tool to keep me from flinging the game away at this moment. As a saving grace, I can go into the settings at any moment to change the difficulty level, which I immediately did. The sad thing about the lower difficulty is it robs combat of its unique strategy, reducing it to a smash-fest which is often over too quickly. In this case, it was worth it, but I grieved the loss of the intriguing back-and-forth elements. I also felt upset that the ingredients were all here for a combat system I would have adored, but it just doesn’t come together. Refusing to be overshadowed, the world is so worth pushing through the frustration to revel in. Every level offers a unique and complex biome with a buffet of side quests, hunting opportunities, resources, and joyful traversal. Though the main story leads me through each realm, often to recruit a personality-filled member of the court I was rebuilding from ashes, there’s so much to see and do besides this. One of my favorite off-the-beaten-path treats is the intricately designed equipment sets – a mind-boggling array of which will never be seen by the player. Each set offers its own elemental buffs, damage defense, or attack stats which could be the difference between victory and defeat. The effort that went into these is impressive – as are the characters and world-building that support the environments they lie in. It’s disappointing how often Tails of Iron 2 leads me to wander the darkened valleys of over-demanding combat and back-track-demanding save points. However, the view from the mountain summits – the game’s secret-filled levels, propelling narrative, and magical visuals – cast sunlight on even my hardest experiences.",

    "content": "Developer Ivy Road • Publisher Annapurna Interactive • Release March 11 • Platforms PS, PC The recent news of Eathblade’s cancelation brought another anticipated indie game to my mind. A game that is, in part, a response to the pressures of creating a follow-up title in the wake of a previous release’s unbelievable popularity. One that also touched me personally, as I was playing it over the winter break — a time I probably should have been relaxing rather than working. Wanderstop examines what we do to ourselves when we push too hard for too long — when the pressure collapses down on us. It’s a gentle probe and a harsh warning. Both feel authentic and empathetic, perhaps because the game’s director Davey Wreden has been there with us before. The Stanley Parable creator has made no secret of his struggles with burnout, and that they directly influenced the themes in his upcoming project. Despite its cozy facade, don’t go in unprepared for Wanderstop’s intensity. I stare at the screen for a moment, unbalanced. Wanderstop — a game I expected to kick off with a warm cup of tea — instead thrust me into a brutal, beautiful, and darker narrative world than I’d anticipated. In mere moments, the game peeled back the layers of a strong, unbeatable warrior, Alta, jolting her vulnerable nerves. Burnout, overworking, obsession with perfection, and throwing mental health to the wayside, all of these flash wildly across the screen, across the heroine’s face. She thinks it’s all been worth it. Until she fails. My thoughts were pounding in the aftermath. The art style transformed from the soft stylistic signature of a cozy game to slashes of hand-drawn sketches and back again. The dialogue punched me in the gut. Like the main character, I needed a second to catch my breath. She decides to take a journey to her old mentor to regain her skills, and I’m along for the ride. She never makes it through the woods. Walking the tree-lined path, the physical and mental weight of my sword becomes too much. It falls from my hand. Soon, I can’t even support my own body and drop to the beaten earth as my legs fail. Enter Boro. A hulking figure of a man, Boro seems like he should be more familiar with combat than tea. He sits next to me gently as I wake, convincing me to recover in his shop rather than push on. I finally gained control of the character and my first act, instead of using my limited demo time wisely to further the main quest, was to rush over to a gaggle of penguin-like creatures I’d spied across the yard. It seemed like a fitting act considering the game’s themes. Pluffins, as the creatures turned out to be, are adorable and offer me the chance to pet and carry them around. From this moment on, you have to imagine everything I’m doing in the demo is done with a Pluffin either in my arms or very nearby. Making tea is a serious and multi-stepped pursuit that starts with farming. Though the idea is common in games of this genre, Wanderstop’s approach is novel. My seeds thrive or transform depending on what pattern I place them in, owing to a touch of magic. I spent a lot of time trying out different arrangements and combinations just to see what would happen — something Davey Wreden was happy to watch me do after quickly check-in, making sure I wasn’t just confused. I enjoyed my time in the garden a little too long, which meant the deeper intricacies of tea making — like figuring out how the whimsical rollercoaster delivery system worked or testing out what the stories-tall glass cauldron did — was lost to me. But it won’t be long until I can dive deeper since Wanderstop is set to release in March, and I can’t wait.",

    "content": "Customer Service in 2020: A customer’s billing issue lands in the queue. 2025: That same billing hiccup gets spotted. Efficiency like this is the future of customer service. While quick fixes are great, challenges like delayed responses, agent burnout, language barriers, and scalability issues remind us that there’s still room for improvement. That’s where a well-designed chatbot can make a real difference. Implementing a chatbot is a strategic move — but the key lies in asking the right questions: Let’s get you those answers. But first things first. A customer service chatbot is a software tool designed to address customer inquiries and resolve issues through automated conversations. It leverages databases to retrieve information, uses customer history to gather context, and tailors contextual responses. These chatbots operate across various platforms, including websites, mobile applications, messaging services like WhatsApp, and social media channels. When unable to resolve an issue, they efficiently escalate the matter to the appropriate human agent. Let’s talk about the benefits AI chatbots bring to customer support. Look past the basic chatbot features. A support tool that doesn’t have these seven features will cost your players and burn out your team. Traditional support forces players to leave their game and describe technical issues they barely understand. The consequence? Endless back-and-forth, wrong diagnoses, and players giving up entirely (AKA rage-quitting). Modern in-game support changes this by directly pulling error logs, device data, and game states. Your team can push fixes, reset features, or trigger tutorials without players leaving their session. Look past basic help content. A customer service chatbot needs a unified help center that merges knowledge bases with live support. Your team can integrate FAQs, support articles, and conduct searches for customers to solve issues with AI chatbots without bouncing between platforms. When users need solutions, they can find them through instant articles or switch to agent chat without leaving their screen. AI tracks what resources work and what needs improvement. When you cut those resolution times, you’ll watch the satisfaction scores rise. Only 25% of internet users speak English natively. Global games need global support. Customer service chatbots with multilingual capabilities meet players in their own language and handle regional slang and cultural contexts. Your Brazilian players get the same quality support as your English players. The system learns from every interaction and gets better at regional gaming slang and local issue patterns. Look at any support team’s tickets: most questions get asked over and over. Smart support automation handles these common issues instantly. The system performs smart issue classification, routes complex problems to specialists, sends auto-updates on ticket status, and resolves simple queries using AI-powered answers without agent help. This frees up your team to tackle unique problems that need a human touch. Context gets lost when support is fragmented across email, chat, and social. A player can start troubleshooting on Twitter, continue in-game, and finish via email. Real omnichannel systems keep the entire conversation history connected. Your team sees every interaction, from in-game messages to social posts. Players pick up their support thread anywhere, anytime. Better still, this helps build a consistent brand presence. Most support tools work in isolation. Without switching between tools, they can’t see player stats, purchase history, or game progress. You can fix this through APIs. Your chatbot creates integrations with CRM systems, pulls live game data, and checks the performances of agents, bots, FAQs, and support teams. Your developers also get the freedom to build custom solutions for unique game mechanics. Look at this simple integration: One line of code [Helpshift.showFAQs(Activity a, Map<String, Object> configMap)] adds complete support features to your app. Players tap ‘Help,’ get instant FAQ access, and can start a support chat if needed. When agents reply, players see a notification right in the app. Most games track surface metrics: solved tickets and response times. Smart analytics dig into CSAT scores, resolution speed, and support volume trends. You can slice this data by game platform, support agent, language, or custom tags. This means spotting bottlenecks fast, like which games need more Japanese speakers or when your weekend team is overwhelmed. These insights help fix problems at the source. Every chatbot offers something different. Let’s break down what you get from the top five chatbots in customer service automation, from features to pricing.

    "content": "In B2B customer service, every interaction matters to the bottom line. One missed alert can impact business relationships and revenue. Top-performing companies understand this and turn their customer service from reactive helpdesks into partnership hubs. And they’re seeing the results — stronger relationships, lower ticket resolution times, and more stable gaming experiences for everyone. The gameplay behind the support is simple: Effective CS service tool × Simplified integration = Scalable support success Check out how companies implement outstanding customer service. B2B customer service refers to all interactions between a business-to-business (B2B) company and its customers. It begins with the sales journey and continues throughout the customer journey, such as contract renewals or purchases. B2B customers depend on their service providers. When you provide support to other businesses (platform providers, payment processors, or server hosts), you protect revenue through retention, enhanced player experiences, and business partnerships. For example, in gaming, a support ticket rarely means a simple fix. It means understanding enterprise contracts, meeting service-level agreements, and protecting business interests on both sides. Speaking of which — there’s a fundamental shift in how B2C support operates compared to customer service B2B. Say, server instability hits during peak hours at a major gaming company. Two support teams spring into action — one handling individual player complaints, the other managing enterprise gaming partners. Team A responds to the player frustrated about lag in their favorite battle royale game. The customer service representative checks the connection, walks through basic troubleshooting, and resolves the issue in 15 minutes. Success metrics: Player satisfaction and quick resolution. Team B tackles an urgent call from a platform partner hosting 50,000 active players. The support team assembles technical leads, checks SLA commitments, and coordinates with multiple stakeholders. Every minute of downtime costs real revenue. Success metrics: Partnership health and business continuity. Now, look at the key differences between the two gaming support models: B2C customer service focuses on end consumers with simple one-to-one interactions, often automated and omnichannel, including social media, email, and chat. Transactions are high in volume but low in value, with feedback centered on user experience and features. In contrast, B2B customer service caters to businesses, involving complex interactions across departments and multiple stakeholders. It emphasizes personalized support through formal channels like email, phone, and in-person meetings managed by dedicated account teams. B2B transactions are fewer but higher in value, with feedback focusing on customization and technical support. While B2C SLAs are less formal, B2B SLAs are well-defined and supported by detailed product training for agents. To cope with the high stakes in B2B and win customers’ trust, customer service must be defined at the front end. Here is the list of 15 examples specially designed for B2B. Support teams fielding repetitive queries face a critical choice: hire more agents or work smarter. But, 73% of users prioritize quick answers over human interaction. Advanced FAQ automation shows how working smarter wins. Quick-search bots scan user queries, matching them with relevant solutions from the knowledge base. Here, the tech doesn’t replace human support — it enhances it. When automated answers don’t solve the issue, conversations thereby transition to support specialists who also understand the context. Time-based automation adds an extra layer of efficiency, automating SLA tracking across open tickets. When an agent hasn’t sent their first response or a user hasn’t replied, automatic triggers kick in. It frees your support teams from manual SLA tracking and lets them focus on solving complex integration issues. The system also handles follow-ups, monitors response gaps, and maintains compliance without constant human oversight. Your partners can rest easy knowing their urgent issues get immediate attention at any hour of the day. Keeping players in the game while resolving issues has proved an effective tactic in gaming customer service. Sybo recently improved its support strategy by integrating SDK-based messaging directly into its game interface. As a result, support time dropped 86%, while customer satisfaction scores jumped from 3.8 to 4.3. Now, players never leave their gaming session to get help. Support teams track real-time engagement, spot emerging issues, and protect revenue streams. For B2B gaming partners, this translates to stronger player retention and more stable communities. Imagine a support ticket arriving at 3 AM with minimal details about an in-game payment issue. Instead of keeping customers waiting in queue, a custom bot launches into action, performing five key diagnostic steps. It pulls error logs, checks backend systems through API connections, asks targeted questions about transaction IDs, platform details, and error messages, and maps the impact across player sessions. Within minutes, it gathers critical data that would’ve taken an agent multiple back-and-forth exchanges. By the time a specialist picks up the case, they have everything needed to dive straight into solving the problem. When a mobile gaming studio receives a flurry of partner tickets, it doesn’t always have to be clear and crisp. But Smart Intents recognize different phrases expressing the same problem — whether a player writes “payment gateway down” or “transaction failures mounting.” No ticket gets lost in translation, and no player waits while support figures out who should handle their case. Payment issues reach the financial integration specialists, while server issues route to the infrastructure team. The best part is the system grows smarter with each interaction, catching the subtle differences between integration issues, payment problems, and server alerts. With Language AI, companies targeting global customers stay front and center as multi-language support spans all corners. Huuuge‘s gaming support team faced a bottleneck recently: players from 195 countries but not enough multilingual agents. But they took swift actions — sought the help of Language AI and ditched the clunky process of switching tabs and copy-pasting translations. Now, English-speaking agents help Russian, Chinese, and Japanese players directly in their native languages. Support flows 24/7 across 36 languages; no specialized language agents are needed. Response times dropped 21%, while player satisfaction jumped, especially in the Asian markets. Support managers have to address certain blind spots regularly: Which agents excel? Do FAQs actually help users? Are response times impacting satisfaction? Traditional metrics tell half-stories, leaving leaders guessing about team effectiveness. A central analytics hub can be your best bet here. It These insights let you refine customer service strategies based on what actually works, not what you think might work. Players hate leaving their game to hunt for answers. Also, your support team hates answering the same questions repeatedly. Digital self-service fixes both problems. Convert those repetitive queries into crisp FAQs, add troubleshooting tools, and watch your players solve problems independently. Bytro Labs proved this works: they tackled 17,000 monthly tickets with just 2.5 agents. Issues needing human touch only reached the team, and the rest were tackled by a self-service knowledge base – the foundation, not an afterthought. Fragmented email threads and slow response times are the best ways to annoy players (and your agents). In a similar situation, switching from email to a modern messaging-based support system changed everything for Jam City. Players now get instant responses without leaving their game, while support teams handle multiple conversations efficiently with the full context of each player’s history. Their ticket volume dropped 30% while customer satisfaction doubled. The real-time messaging system also provided valuable insights into recurring issues. Adapting to modern customer service enhancement meets not only the demand of customers but also the overall quality of customer service. Your support agents burn out when ticket volumes increase and resolution time suffers. But with task automation, the agent saves time(and energy) When you automate a task, operations continue without interruptions as support platforms automatically tag tickets, route them to the right specialists, and send instant acknowledgments to customers. When simple issues come in, they’re resolved automatically with helpful responses. After preset timeframes, tickets update their status without manual intervention. Thus, issues that require human expertise (only) are aligned with agents. Coordination between teams is a serious gap that needs to be addressed. Support managers can’t effectively track agent workload when critical player issues involve multiple departments, and your developers miss insights about recurring problems. A unified analytics dashboard solves this. You get real-time visibility across teams, track your support queues, measure agent performance, and evaluate self-help effectiveness all in one place. Your teams can also monitor essential KPIs and customer sentiment instantly. Let’s say a customer reports a server glitch in a critical match, but your support team is swamped. Handling it becomes haywire now. But then, If you have an AI chatbot, it deciphers the issue using natural language processing (NLP), identifies it as a server problem, and provides an immediate workaround from your approved content. But, if the issue is too complex, the bot routes it to a specialist with all the necessary context. Ultimately, your players stay in the game, your CSAT scores improve, and your reputation stays intact. Fragmented interactions can create chaos for your team, especially when agents switch between Facebook, Discord, and WhatsApp conversations. Here, a multichannel communication system is key to bringing teams together for collective collaboration. By unifying messaging from multiple channels; your team can access complete conversation histories in one place where everyone stays on the same page. Whether messaging, phone calls, or self-service options, your team can work together like never before. There is no guesswork when it comes to customer service effectiveness. The feedback bots engage customers right after resolution through purposeful conversation steps. Through focused check-ins, it sees if customers got what they needed, gathers insights about their experience, and catches anyone still stuck. This way, routine follow-ups become opportunities to improve player support and strengthen service quality through real player insights. Console players hit a wall when errors pop up. Controller typing turns a simple support request into a tedious ordeal. QR codes placed on error screens or packaging provide instant mobile access to support. Players can scan to join discussions, access FAQs, or connect with the community all through phones. It helps keep players with quick navigation for resolution without having to juggle across menus to connect with the right experts. You save your customer time and also a headache ^_^ The B2B customer service examples we’ve explored show how modern support tools transform reactive helpdesks into strategic assets. Helpshift brings these capabilities together: Your gaming partnerships carry high stakes — every support interaction impacts thousands of players and real revenue.

    "content": "💬: Hey, where’s my package? — Instant answers, no hold music. 🎮: Can you trade me that rare sword? — Non-Playable Character (NPC) responds like a pro 💬: What’s 2+2? — Okay, sometimes it’s the little things. This is how everything began…From simple Q&As to handling complex queries, text-based conversational AI has redefined how we communicate — just a message away. The truth is traditional support can’t keep up with customers who expect answers at random times. Instead, conversational artificial intelligence solves customer problems instantly, with a pop-up appearing in the right-hand corner of the screen. Conversational AI for customer service reduces response times from hours to seconds and slashes operational costs by half. Let’s see how. Conversational AI for customer service is an advanced support technology that automates interactions through Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). Unlike basic chatbots with rigid scripts, It provides faster support by reading context, delivering relevant solutions, and engaging in human-like conversations. It recognizes speech and text inputs, comprehends intent, mimics human language, and provides multilingual support. For business leaders, it impacts two metrics: Unlike the age-old rule-based chatbots, modern conversational AI learns (with every conversation) to improve response accuracy and relevance. “The use of AI in customer service is a great example of how AI and humans can work together. Training AI to understand language, determine intent, and triage problems through well-defined workflows helps offload the grunt work from the agents, allowing them to focus on problem-solving, creative solutions, and empathy for the customer.” – Erik Ashby, Senior Director and Head of Product at Helpshift. Technical terms won’t solve support tickets. Your customers need solutions in their language at their convenience. For that, the following components of conversational AI need to work together. NLP decodes customer messages like a support agent who speaks multiple languages. When players write “can’t connect,” “connection error,” or “game offline,” NLP recognizes these variations as network issues. It spots problem types, urgency levels, and key details that help deliver the right solutions. Like a support lead who remembers every customer interaction, Dialog Manager tracks your conversation’s progress. It knows which solutions you’ve tried, what worked, what didn’t, and what to try next. When you say “that didn’t work,” it remembers which fix you attempted and moves on to better options. NLG turns raw data into clear support messages. After understanding your customer’s problem and deciding how to help, NLG crafts the response. For example, when detecting a server connection problem, rather than displaying “Network_Error_0x8007”, NLG creates readable responses: “We see you’re offline. First, check if your WiFi is connected, then try logging in again.” These components work together to build good conversational AI customer service. But most support solutions promise automation, but few deliver real results. The difference lies in training. AI must learn from millions of customer conversations to understand and solve problems. For example, Helpshift built its AI models by training the machine using billions of support interactions. The system automatically connects customers to knowledge base articles that may solve their problems before you have to get a human agent involved. It offers a self-serve experience and in-chat instructions based on customer intent. This smart workload distribution helps your agents reduce response times and increase customer satisfaction score (CSAT). Now, let’s put all of this into context. Say there’s a gaming support issue; here’s how the conversational AI works, from receiving the user query to delivering the solution. When players message support, the system receives their text requests. A player having trouble with in-game purchases might write: “Bought 1000 gems but didn’t get them. Order ID #GEM789.” The system takes in this raw message. NLP digs into what the player needs. Our example identifies this as a missing purchase issue. It picks up details: the purchase amount (1000 gems), the problem (items not received), and the order reference (ID #GEM789). It understands this isn’t a gameplay issue or connection problem but a transaction concern. Players phrase the same problem differently: NLP recognizes these variations point to the same issue. The dialog manager makes sure we have every detail needed to help. For this missing gems ticket, it checks: It asks specific questions if crucial information is missing: “Could you confirm the email address linked to your purchase? This helps us track your transaction faster.” This step turns raw data into clear updates. Instead of: TRANSACTION_STATUS: COMPLETED DELIVERY_STATUS: PENDING DELAY_TIME: 5_MIN It creates messages in customers’ language like: “Your payment for 1000 gems has been confirmed. Due to high server traffic, there’s a 5-minute delay in delivery. Your gems will appear automatically; there is no need to restart the game.” It’s the final step that delivers this response to the player in their chat window with clear information about their purchase status. All this happens in seconds, and player concern now becomes reassurance. Conversational AI is an asset for your customer service teams. Here are seven reasons why. Improve agent efficiency as your team spends less time on repetitive questions about order status, account access, or basic troubleshooting. Conversational AI handles 3.5x more tickets without adding headcount. This means your existing team can manage higher ticket volumes without getting overwhelmed or compromising on quality. Break down language barriers in customer support without hiring multilingual teams. Multilingual customer support accurately detects and responds in customers’ preferred languages to maintain consistent service quality across regions. Enter new markets confidently and serve diverse customer bases with standardized support processes. Ensure customers get help whenever they need it, even outside business hours. Conversational AI provides round-the-clock first-level support with common queries and urgent issues immediately. Your customers don’t have to wait for the next business day to get basic problems solved. Conversational AI for customer service helps your teams track which issues come up most frequently, identify emerging problems, and understand where customers get stuck. With such analytics and solid data, you improve self-service resources, refine product features, and train your team on what matters most to customers. Meet customers on their preferred platforms: email, messaging, or in-app support. An omnichannel support system promises consistent service quality across all channels. Your team maintains context across interactions by avoiding repetitive customer questions. Scale customer support as your business expands. Handle increasing support volumes without proportional team expansion. Your support system adapts to growth spikes during product launches or seasonal peaks. Customers who receive fast, relevant solutions are more likely to make repeat purchases and recommend your business to others. You’ll also see higher CSAT scores when customers get instant, accurate answers. So, no customer frustration; it only builds trust. Let’s look at the types of conversational AI for customer support that makes these benefits possible. Now, look at how top companies use conversational AI to solve business challenges. Banking: Bank of America’s virtual assistant Erica helps 1 billion customers annually to manage their money better. It sends timely alerts about unusual charges, suggests smart spending habits, and teaches practical money skills. Most importantly, it catches potential fraud before customers lose money. Retail: Sephora shows how personalized support drives sales and loyalty. Their Virtual Artist helps customers try makeup virtually and find perfect products. Shoppers book store appointments, check product availability, and even identify makeup from celebrity photos. Human Resources: HR teams use support conversations to find great talent faster. Take Hewlett Packard: their hiring system matches candidate skills with perfect job openings. In early 2023, website visits doubled to 950,000, with 26% of visitors becoming HP employees. The system handles initial screening while HR focuses on choosing the best cultural fit. Gaming: Studios handle massive support volumes during launches and tournaments. Huuuge‘s success story shows how instant problem-solving keeps players happy. When millions log in simultaneously, automated systems tackle connection issues and purchase problems across languages and time zones. Marketing: Mountain Dew’s DEWbot connected with gamers during their “Rig Up” Twitch series, earning a Short Award nomination. Support messages evolved into genuine fan engagement, proving that solving problems builds lasting customer relationships. Every support crisis begins with a moment of truth. For gaming companies, it’s often launch day. For eCommerce, it’s a holiday rush. Moments like these define customer loyalty, and you have a smart conversational AI strategy in place. We’ll show you how to implement one. If your customer, Laura, is troubleshooting a connection issue during an online tournament at midnight, she needs a solution right now in clear and simple terms. A “We’ll get back to you soon” message is the last thing she wants to see. To create an effective AI strategy, analyze what your customers frequently ask. Use existing support data to map the most common problems and pinpoint pain points. Ask questions like: For every query, design workflows that address the issue fully. For example, when Laura reports a “server connection error,” the conversation should not end with “server connection error.” Instead, it should follow up with next steps: “Your connection is unstable. Try switching to a wired connection or closing background apps. If the issue persists, we’re here to help.” Test these flows repeatedly with real customer scenarios to make sure they’re seamless. Introducing AI shouldn’t disrupt your existing processes. Instead, integrate it into tools your team already uses. For instance, Helpshift’s conversational AI plugs directly into customer service platforms, reducing setup hassle. A quick tip: Start small. Automate FAQs or repetitive tickets before scaling to complex interactions. Your team is key to conversational AI success. Equip your agents with training on how AI works and how it assists. For example, when Laura escalates her issue, the agent should see the AI’s previous interactions and step in when needed. Agents become more confident and skilled in managing AI-assisted workflows with regular training. Every conversation is a learning opportunity. Use AI to track patterns in customer concerns and improve over time. For instance, if many customers like Laura report lag during peak hours, flag this as a process improvement area. Regularly update your AI with these learnings to keep it evolving alongside your customers’ needs. Running a support team? Here’s how Helpshift’s tech makes your life easier. ✔ Smart support tools: Four purpose-built bots handle different support scenarios. Need to check user identity? There’s a bot for that.

    "content": "Marketing an indie game is a crucial aspect of the game development process, often determining the game's success or failure in a highly competitive market. This article delves into the various channels available for promoting indie games, guiding developers on how to effectively utilize them to reach their audience and build a loyal fan base. Indie game marketing is not just about promoting a product; it's about creating an engaging story around the game and its developers. This includes establishing a brand identity, interacting with potential players, and cultivating a community. The narrative woven around the game can be as compelling as the gameplay itself, drawing players into the world the developers have created. This storytelling aspect can manifest through various channels, such as behind-the-scenes videos, developer blogs, and social media updates that share the journey of game development, including the challenges and triumphs faced along the way. Successful marketing strategies require a thorough understanding of your target audience. This involves identifying who your players are, what platforms they frequent, and what kind of content resonates with them. By aligning marketing efforts with the preferences of your audience, you can more effectively capture their interest and encourage them to try your game. Engaging with players through surveys or beta testing can provide invaluable insights, allowing developers to tailor their messaging and promotional content to better meet audience expectations and desires. In the indie game landscape, marketing can often be the difference between obscurity and success. Unlike established studios with large budgets, indie developers must rely on creative marketing strategies and grassroots efforts to promote their games. This often means leveraging social media platforms, engaging with gaming influencers, and participating in gaming events or conventions to showcase their work. By building relationships with content creators and streamers, indie developers can tap into existing audiences and gain credibility through authentic endorsements. Effective marketing helps indie games gain visibility, attract players, and generate buzz prior to and following a release. It can also contribute to long-term success through community building, encouraging ongoing engagement and support from fans. A strong community can lead to word-of-mouth marketing, which is invaluable for indie games. Developers can foster this sense of community by actively participating in forums, hosting live Q&A sessions, and creating spaces for players to share their experiences and feedback, thus nurturing a loyal fanbase that feels invested in the game's success. Despite the importance of marketing, indie developers face several challenges. Limited budgets mean fewer resources for advertising and promotion, making it essential to prioritize organic reach and community engagement. Many indie developers find themselves wearing multiple hats, often juggling game design and marketing responsibilities, which can stretch their time and energy thin. This multifaceted approach requires not only creativity but also a willingness to learn and adapt to new marketing techniques and platforms. Additionally, the saturated gaming market can make it difficult for indie games to stand out. Developers must also navigate the rapidly changing landscape of social media and marketing trends, which can quickly evolve and affect visibility strategies. Staying updated with the latest trends, such as the rise of TikTok for game promotion or the importance of short-form video content, is crucial. Furthermore, understanding the algorithms that govern these platforms can help indie developers optimize their content for better reach and engagement, ensuring their games don’t get lost in the noise of countless releases. Social media has forever changed the way indie games are marketed. From sharing game updates to engaging with fans, these platforms provide invaluable opportunities for developers. Each platform offers unique advantages, allowing developers to cater their content accordingly. Focusing on the right social media channels can significantly boost an indie game's outreach and engagement. Let’s explore the key platforms that can be leveraged for marketing purposes. Facebook allows indie developers to tap into vast user demographics. It's a great platform for creating a community around your game and hosting events, such as livestreams or Q&A sessions. Developers can create dedicated pages for their games, post updates, and engage with followers. Additionally, Facebook Ads can be targeted to specific audiences, making it an effective tool for reaching potential players. Twitter has transformed into a lively hub for indie developers to share their progress and connect directly with their audience. The brevity of the platform encourages quick updates and interaction. Using relevant hashtags, developers can reach beyond their existing followers and tap into conversations around indie gaming, game jams, and other relevant topics, facilitating organic growth in visibility and engagement. For indie games with compelling visuals, Instagram is the ideal platform for promotion. The app's focus on imagery allows developers to showcase art, screenshots, and gameplay in an engaging format. Moreover, Instagram stories and reels provide opportunities for developers to share behind-the-scenes content, fostering a connection with followers and potential players. Engaging aesthetics can significantly enhance interest and excitement around the game. Engagement in gaming communities and forums is a powerful method for promoting indie games. These spaces allow developers to connect with passionate players and industry peers, gaining insights and feedback about their games. Choosing the right platforms to interact with communities can significantly impact the game's visibility and reputation. Here are a few platforms where indie games can thrive. Reddit hosts numerous communities dedicated to gaming, including several specifically for indie games. Subreddits such as r/indiegames provide a space for sharing game updates, receiving feedback, and building excitement ahead of release. Developers need to engage with the community genuinely—by participating in discussions and contributing valuable content rather than solely promoting their games, which can lead to a more positive response from Reddit users. Being present on the Steam Community is critical for any indie developer planning to release their game on the platform. It's an excellent ecosystem for engaging with players through discussions, updates, and events. Developers can utilize Steam's features to share news, respond to community queries, and create an area for fan discussions. This interaction adds to the game's visibility and builds a loyal following. IndieDB is a dedicated platform for indie games, offering developers a place to showcase their projects. Here, developers can share updates, news, and even beta versions to gather feedback. Using sites like IndieDB can help indie developers cultivate a following while simultaneously gaining exposure to a wider audience interested in indie titles. Engaging in user discussions and responding to feedback is vital for maximizing this platform's potential. Email remains one of the most effective marketing tools available, allowing developers to communicate directly with their audience without the interference of algorithms. Building an email list can lead to increased engagement from loyal supporters. The effectiveness of email marketing lies in its ability to deliver personalized content and announcements straight to subscribers’ inboxes. Here's how to get started. To build a strong email list, developers should create incentives for potential subscribers, such as exclusive content, promotional discounts, or early access to game demos. This exchange encourages visitors to join the mailing list. Promoting the email sign-up through social media, the game’s website, and during community events can help grow the list significantly, ensuring that the developer has an engaged audience to communicate with upon launch. Engaging email content is key to keeping subscribers interested. This can include game updates, developer insights, and upcoming events or promotions. Use eye-catching visuals and compelling calls-to-action to solicit direct responses from your audience. By consistently providing value in your emails, you can maintain engagement levels and build anticipation for your game’s release. Influencer marketing has emerged as a powerful strategy for indie developers looking to extend their reach. Collaborating with popular streamers and content creators can give your game exposure to a larger audience. It’s essential to approach influencer marketing thoughtfully, ensuring that the chosen influencers align well with your game and target demographic. When searching for influencers, consider their audience engagement, content style, and relevance to your game genre. Collaboration with influencers who have a genuine interest in indie games will likely result in a more authentic promotion. Analyzing engagement metrics can also provide insight into whether an influencer’s audience would resonate with your game, ensuring an effective partnership. Working with streamers and YouTubers can create invaluable exposure through gameplay showcases and reviews. Hosting playtesting sessions or providing early access copies can encourage these influencers to share their gameplay experiences. Fostering a genuine relationship with influencers is crucial for long-term success. Regular interactions can lead to collaborative content, increasing the potential for viral marketing. In conclusion, successful indie game marketing involves leveraging a combination of social media, community engagement, email marketing, and influencer partnerships. By understanding the nuances of each channel and actively connecting with players, developers can significantly enhance their game's visibility and success in the competitive gaming market.

    "content": "This article is based on Dave Steer’s enlightening talk at the Product Marketing Summit, hosted by our sister community, Product Marketing Alliance. Let’s talk about something that’s probably on everyone’s mind right now: AI and its impact on our roles. First, a little intro. I’m Dave, and I lead the brand and product marketing team at GitLab. In case you’re unfamiliar with it, GitLab is what we call a DevSecOps platform. Essentially, it brings developers, security teams, and operations together in one place so they can collaborate at scale and ship better, more secure software faster. Today, we’re diving into a topic that’s connected to what we do at GitLab but extends far beyond it. It’s a conversation about AI – both the promise and the pitfalls. This isn’t about cheerleading for AI adoption or sounding the alarm about its risks. It’s about holding both perspectives at the same time. We’ll explore current trends, look at new data, and discuss practical use cases. By the end of this, I promise you’ll walk away with actionable tips for experimenting with AI at work. Let me start with two “aha” moments I’ve had with AI in the past year. You know those moments when the light bulb goes off, and you suddenly see both the potential and the challenges of something? The first moment ties back to GitLab. Over the past two years, my team and I have been working on bringing what we call GitLab Duo to market. GitLab Duo is essentially our suite of AI tools integrated across the software development lifecycle, giving engineers end-to-end workflows powered by AI. The “aha” for me was this: if we’re doing this for engineers, why aren’t we doing it for product marketers too? Think about it – what if we could integrate AI into every part of our workflows? There’s a lot of potential there, but it also requires careful thought. My second “aha” moment happened when I learned sales negotiation skills from AI. Here’s the story: about a year ago, when AI hype was at its peak, I came across a site called More Useful Things. It’s run by a Wharton professor who teaches MBA concepts like sales negotiation and case studies using AI. The resource library includes a set of prompts anyone can use. One of them caught my eye: a role-playing scenario where the AI acts as both mentor and customer. The idea is to practice selling by interacting with the AI as if it were your buyer. I decided to tweak the prompt. I set the stage as if I were a GitLab seller pitching our DevSecOps platform to a C-level executive. Within minutes, I was deep into a back-and-forth roleplay with the AI. Here’s what blew my mind: the AI wasn’t just playing along. It stress-tested my discovery questions, even though I’m the one who writes them. It challenged my objection-handling techniques. At one point, it even paused the scenario and said, “Hey, Dave, here’s something you could improve.” Imagine that – a robot teaching me about my own messaging and positioning. And it was right! That experience hooked me instantly. My big takeaway? AI is going to change everything. It’s not just a tool; it’s a game-changer for how we learn, work, and refine our craft. If you’ve ever wondered whether AI will affect your job, here’s the spoiler: AI is going to impact all of our jobs. Wharton’s research examining over 1,000 professions revealed that only 3.5% of them don’t overlap with AI capabilities. Professions like dancing and bricklaying might seem safe, but even those are subject to AI’s influence – think about how dance coaches or construction project managers could integrate AI into their roles. So, the real question isn’t “Will AI impact my job?” but “How will AI impact my job?” For product marketers specifically, it’s worth considering how our roles will evolve and how we can use AI to eliminate mundane tasks and focus on strategic opportunities. AI isn’t the first assistive technology to transform the way we work. Look back at how power tools revolutionized carpentry – they didn’t eliminate carpenters; they made them more efficient, enabling them to tackle more ambitious projects. Similarly, spreadsheets didn’t replace accountants; they freed them up to focus on complex, strategic financial decisions. Digital cameras didn’t eliminate photographers; they encouraged creativity and experimentation by removing the need to develop film. The same is true for product marketing. AI isn’t going to replace product marketers – but it will push us to rethink what parts of our jobs can be automated so we can spend more time on strategic, high-impact work. Here’s the good news: almost all of us are already using AI. In a recent survey I conducted in partnership with Product Marketing Alliance, an astounding 96% of marketers said they’re currently using AI tools in their roles. Even more interesting, 60% of respondents only started using AI in the past year, and 83% plan to increase their use of AI in the next 12 months. In short, we’re all fairly new to this, but we’re diving in headfirst. And the data suggests we’re pushing through the traditional hype cycle faster than ever. While this isn’t an official Gartner hype cycle, it’s a useful framework to understand where we stand with AI. The “innovation trigger” kicked off just a couple of years ago with the launch of ChatGPT. Almost overnight, every company seemed to claim they were “powered by AI,” and the hype hit its peak. But now, we’re moving past inflated expectations and transitioning into the “slope of enlightenment.” This is where careful testing of use cases leads to meaningful integration, eventually bringing us to the “plateau of productivity.” Another study by McKinsey highlights that AI is being adopted across more business functions than ever before. Nearly half of companies report using AI in two or more functions, with sales and marketing leading the way. For product marketing teams, this means we’re at the forefront of AI adoption – collaborating with sales to innovate, experiment, and define best practices. AI isn’t just a passing trend; it’s here to stay, and it’s reshaping how we work for the better. So, what’s behind the rapid adoption of AI? Why are we all jumping on board? While there are several reasons, I believe one key factor is that AI is helping address one of the biggest challenges product marketers face: the product marketing ratio problem. If you’re a product marketer, you’ve probably felt this – the delicate balance between the number of product marketers (PMMs) and product managers (PMs). Get the ratio right, and you can achieve work-life balance while delivering a big impact. Get it wrong, and you’re constantly playing catch-up. But what is the “right” ratio? A study of the top 100 software companies looked at the top-performing quartile and found the ideal ratio was one PMM for every 1.6 PMs. Now, be honest – is the ratio of PMMs to PMs even close to that at your company? Yeah, that’s what I thought. Product marketing is a critical, strategic function, but too often we’re stuck playing catch-up. That means we risk being seen internally as what my friend Liza Adams calls the “master of the battlecard” or the “creator of the customer deck.” These are important deliverables, but they’re not the essence of what we do as product marketers. Here’s the good news: AI has the potential to transform us into what I call the 10x PMM.",

    "content": "Algorithms have become ubiquitous, influencing nearly every decision-making process in our daily lives—from job applications to mortgage approvals. Despite their efficiency and consistency, one pressing question remains: how do consumers feel about decisions made by robots (bots) versus humans? Recent research reveals a surprising twist: while unfavorable decisions (e.g., rejections) elicit similar consumer reactions regardless of the source, favorable decisions (e.g., acceptances) spark notably less enthusiasm when made by an algorithm than by a human. This insight challenges assumptions many managers and marketers hold, and it underscores the need for a nuanced approach to integrating algorithms into consumer-facing interactions. As a Top Product Marketing Voice, with years of experience driving revenue growth (+124% U.S. revenue growth) and improving customer retention (+31% retention boost), I’ve seen firsthand how understanding consumer sentiment can make or break a product strategy. Let’s explore key takeaways from this research and how marketers can address the human-bot tension effectively. Help shape the State of Developer Adoption 2025 Report that we're building together with Instruqt. Share your insights and spotlight the top tactics for driving developer adoption of your products. 🕐 Just 4 mins. Big impact. At its core, the difference in consumer reactions to algorithmic and human decisions lies in attribution. When receiving favorable decisions from a human, consumers tend to internalize the outcome, interpreting it as a reflection of their unique value or worth. This personal validation fosters stronger emotional connections. On the other hand, favorable decisions delivered by algorithms often feel transactional. Consumers struggle to ascribe the same personal meaning, leading to a muted positive response. In the case of unfavorable decisions, however, consumers react similarly to both algorithms and humans. Rejections are often externalized—blamed on biases, flawed criteria, or systemic issues—regardless of who or what delivers the news. Marketers increasingly rely on algorithms for decision-making at scale, but this research highlights the importance of humanizing these processes. Drawing from my experience leading global product marketing initiatives, here are three actionable strategies: Since consumers respond less positively to algorithmic acceptances, marketers should focus on making these interactions feel personal and empathetic. Simple adjustments to messaging can bridge the emotional gap. Instead of: “Approved by our system.” “Congratulations! After carefully reviewing your application, we’re excited to share this decision with you.” Even automated messages can adopt a tone that mimics human interaction. Alternatively, hybrid models, where algorithms handle evaluations but humans communicate results, can boost consumer satisfaction. Case in action: During my tenure at one company, we leveraged AI to analyze client needs but paired it with personal outreach from our team. This dual approach contributed to our 90% global revenue growth, ensuring clients felt valued beyond the data. Consumers externalize unfavorable decisions, so marketers can mitigate negative emotions by emphasizing objective criteria and offering actionable next steps. Transparency about the process makes rejection feel less like a personal failure. “Based on current eligibility criteria, we cannot approve your request at this time. We encourage you to reapply once these factors improve.” Providing constructive feedback or alternatives, such as resources for improvement, shifts the narrative from rejection to opportunity. Case in action: At Amazon, our team tackled user churn by introducing personalized improvement recommendations based on behavioral data. This approach didn’t just soften the blow of cancellations—it drove a 31% improvement in customer retention. A lack of understanding often fuels consumer skepticism toward algorithmic decisions. By demystifying how algorithms work, companies can build trust and reduce negative reactions. For instance, a fintech app could explain: “Our algorithm uses industry-leading data models to analyze your profile and provide decisions tailored to your unique circumstances. Here’s how it works...” Transparency instills confidence, making it easier for consumers to accept decisions—whether favorable or not. Case in action: During my time at TomTom, we introduced user-friendly dashboards to explain how our navigation algorithms optimized routes. This increased user trust, contributing to over $40 million in incremental sales from new services. One striking finding from the research was the disconnect between managers’ predictions and consumer reactions. Managers often overestimate how positively consumers will respond to algorithmic decisions, particularly favorable ones. To close this gap, managers need to adopt a more consumer-centric mindset. Here’s how: As AI adoption accelerates, the solution isn’t to choose between humans and bots but to integrate both in ways that maximize their strengths. Algorithms offer unparalleled efficiency and consistency, while humans bring empathy and emotional intelligence to the table. Imagine a healthcare scenario where an algorithm diagnoses a patient with precision, but a doctor delivers the results with compassion and discusses the treatment plan. This balance ensures both accuracy and emotional support. For product marketers, the same principle applies. Whether it’s a subscription service, SaaS product, or fintech app, the winning strategy lies in pairing data-driven decision-making with human-centric communication. The findings on consumer reactions to algorithmic versus human decisions offer profound lessons for product marketers. Here’s what we can take away: As someone who’s worked on both sides of the equation—leveraging cutting-edge algorithms and crafting empathetic marketing strategies—I’ve seen the transformative impact of balancing efficiency with humanity. The question isn’t whether consumers will interact with algorithms—they already do. The real question is how marketers can design these interactions to resonate emotionally and drive lasting loyalty. By understanding the nuances of consumer reactions and implementing strategies that humanize algorithmic successes, depersonalize rejections, and build trust through education, product marketers can thrive in this hybrid world. As I reflect on my journey—from driving $40M in new revenue streams at TomTom to creating award-winning retention strategies at Amazon—one truth stands out: technology may be the engine, but empathy is the fuel. The future of product marketing lies in finding harmony between the bot and the human. Let’s embrace it. It only takes 4 mins to shape developer adoption. Together with Instruqt, we’re building a report that'll: ✅ Benchmark orgs against industry trends ✅ Shape the way companies approach dev adoption ✅ Show which tools work best for driving adoption Your experience makes all the difference, so take our survey to help us create the guidebook on adoption.",

    "content": "Hey, did you know that top engineering leaders believe that \"business alignment\" is their top challenge? If you think marketing to them is just like marketing to developers, let me stop you right there. These are the people juggling strategy, team morale, and technical challenges while keeping the C-suite happy. And trust me, your buzzwords aren’t cutting it. If your pitch is all hype and no substance, they’ll ignore it faster than you can say “seamless integration.” Why? Because engineering leaders don’t care about fluff. They’re practical, skeptical, and ridiculously busy. To really connect with them, you’ve got to step into their shoes. It’s not just about knowing what they do, it’s about understanding how they think. Picture an engineering leader juggling three critical meetings, a code review, a product roadmap discussion, and a budget justification to the CFO, all in one day. Their world is a constant balancing act, requiring both technical precision and business acumen. Let’s break it down. Engineering leaders are the translators between engineering teams and the C-suite. They switch between two gears: If your marketing only speaks to one of these modes, you’re missing half the picture. Great engineering leaders are also people managers. They’re hyper-aware of burnout, team morale, and individual productivity. If your product doesn’t reduce late nights or make onboarding easier, it’s a non-starter. Every decision they make is under scrutiny: Your product doesn’t just need to work, it needs to help them justify their choices to both sides. Developers care about how something works. Engineering leaders care about why it matters. They’re asking questions like: If you’re just listing features or talking about ease of use, you’re missing the bigger picture. Engineering leaders have a radar for BS. If your pitch is full of buzzwords like “next-gen disruption” or “paradigm shift” and feels too polished, they’ll assume you’re hiding something. They prefer clear, straightforward language that focuses on tangible outcomes. They prefer raw, unfiltered demos and honest answers over flashy presentations. They’re not looking for tools that do “cool things.” They need solutions to specific headaches, like: If you’re not addressing these pain points, you’re wasting their time. Before you start writing copy, put yourself in their shoes. What’s stressing them out? What’s keeping them awake at night? If you can’t answer these questions, you’re not ready to market to them yet. Engineering leaders prioritize a few things: Let’s get practical. These strategies work because they tap into what engineering leaders deal with every day, from balancing tricky tech decisions with business goals to keeping their teams running smoothly. These people don’t trust easily, especially not marketers. Build credibility by: Let’s skip the fluff and get to the good stuff. These types of content work because they’re packed with practical knowledge and real takeaways, things engineering leaders can actually use to tackle their daily challenges. Engineering leaders aren’t hanging out in random corners of the internet. Meet them where they already are: If you want to market to engineering leaders, stop thinking like a marketer and start thinking like them. They don’t care about flashy campaigns or vague promises. They care about real solutions to real problems. Show them you understand their world, give them proof your product can help, and speak to them like a human, not a sales deck. And remember, their challenges are constantly evolving, so your strategies should too. Continuously seek feedback, monitor trends, and adapt your approach to stay relevant. Get this right, and you won’t just earn their attention, you’ll earn their respect. And that’s what turns marketing into real results.
