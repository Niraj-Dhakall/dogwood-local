    "content": "Into the Breach, Subset Games' tiny tactics game about mechs fighting bugs across continents and timelines, was a treat and one of the few games I could run on my non-gaming laptop when it came out in 2018. Its core gameplay loop was gloriously simple, but endlessly replayable, as you unlocked new teams of mechs with fresh abilities and the roguelike gameplay randomized the encounters you faced on each new run. With Bug Hunter in UFO 50 — the second game released by the fictional company UFO Soft — developer mossmouth has, somehow, simplified Into the Breach further. The influence is unmistakable. Though you no longer control mechs, your space soldier is still fighting a war against giant bugs. UFO 50 makes me feel like a kid again. The abilities at your disposal are straight out of Into the Breach, too. You can hit your insectoid enemies with lasers from afar, or push them into chasms, dispatching them instantly. Over the course of a match, the bugs will evolve, becoming more powerful and/or tougher to kill. Eventually, they'll turn into eggs. At that point, if you don't kill them by the end of the turn, they'll hatch, filling the screen with bugs and ending your run. As with Into the Breach, you often know exactly what's about to happen; the challenge is in stopping it. Energy pellets are scattered around the battlefield and they're one of the big shifts away from Into the Breach. Instead of having a set amount of moves that never changes, every time you collect two energy pellets, you have the option to buy a new ability. That can be an attack or a move, so you have to think carefully about how it will work in concert with the other skills in your roster. Once you purchase it, that ability occupies that slot going forward, so while you might want to swap your spent move ability instead of a fresh attack, you might need the move more in the next round. It's delightfully complex and tough-as-nails — certainly tougher out the gate than Into the Breach — and demands constant trade-offs. So far, I've only made it past the first round once. There's so much to manage. The eggs on the board, which will end your turn if they hatch; the amount of enemies you need to kill to finish the round; the number of turns you have left to kill them. And little things that you ignore one round become big things that kill you the next. It can be a bit overwhelming but, well, that's kind of UFO 50's whole thing. This is a game that gives you 50 full games right off the bat. As the Steam page stresses, \"these are NOT minigames or microgames! Although the size of each game varies, every one is a complete experience, from its opening title screen to its ending credits.\" Bug Hunter feels complex because it's just one of 50 games that I got all at once for 25 bucks. If this was a standalone game, it might seem too simple to buy on its own. But as 1/50th of a collection, it feels wildly ambitious. Into the Breach was always good, but it's tactical perfection on a phone screen. We want to hear from you! Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful.

Thomas Mahler is right about rejecting consultants, but he's not talking about the same types the base he's appealing to are Max Caulfield deserves more than to have her life still revolve around someone that didn’t treat her well.

    "source_url": "https://www.thegamer.com/tag/indie-games/",
    "content": "I gasped, I blushed, I groaned, and I laughed out loud. Building Relationships is the weirdest, funniest game I’ve played in a while, and I need more right now. While the dating sim didn’t have its own booth at Gamescom Asia, I met Building Relationship’s sole developer Tanat Boozayaangool after a panel I’d given about expanding global media attention for Southeast Asian games where I’d talked for several minutes about how much I love well-formatted cold emails with proper press kits. He sent me a message saying “hello how do I cold email you irl (tanat).” Later, at an afterparty, he gave me a sticker sheet that had text like “Can I feel your load-bearing walls?” and “will you use my back door” superimposed over various building structures. You can extrapolate Building Relationship’s entire vibe from this information. Yes, it’s wild. I went home and played the demo that weekend, which was available as part of Steam Next Fest. October 2024. Steam Next Fest. Best demos. You're in the right place. I’m not really into dating sims unless they’re weird in some major way, and Building Relationships is exactly that. For one, you’re not a person, but a house, and you’re trying to date other houses, or Bachelorx Pads. The demo has you rolling around (you don’t have legs, you’re a house) an island full of other houses who might be here with their partners, or are single and very down to mingle. You’ll find other houses scattered around the island. Some may be Bachelorx Pads, who will hit on you very aggressively – I’m no prude, but I found myself blushing at their forwardness, then laughing at the extended tight shots of each building that somehow, incredibly, demonstrated sexual tension between two inanimate objects. Some may be Chesters, chests that conduct community surveys. One asked me if I was a top or a bottom, which made me bury my face in my hands despite the fact that nobody was around to see my answer. Another, hiding in a field, bemoaned being burnt out, and honestly, aren’t we all? Still more structures will offer you gifts that give you new skills. I received two satellite dishes, allowing me to jump and double-jump, and I was very pleased to discover that each leap was punctuated with a little ‘honk’ sound that at times harmonised with the game’s chirpy background music. Another gift allowed me to dash, which meant I could jump off the edge of a cliff and fling my house violently across the map. What a treat. There are some light platforming elements to the game in that you can collect coins around the island, and some may be in places that are tricky to reach without some precise jumping. I even got a fishing rod, because absurdly, you can fish in Building Relationships. Except you’re not actually catching fish, but underwater cars. It’s so stupid. I love it. It would be so easy for Building Relationships to stray into the realm of the gratuitous or irony-pilled, but the humour feels spot on in its absurdity. From the bizarre puns hinting at sexual innuendo to the hilariously relatable dialogue, it all just works. One house said they didn’t know how to tell their partner that they “HATE bouldering”, which I definitely get. And I laughed out loud when my pal Mint said they’d cleared a path for me, and when I asked how, responded, “Haha I shot it with a gun.” Perhaps my favourite thing about the demo was how it closed. I went to a picnic to meet the other Bachelorx Pads, but bumped into Mint at the entrance where they told me that we needed food, and I’d have to cook some with the ingredients they had. These ingredients turned out to be parts of a table, and cooking meant building the furniture. I love building Ikea furniture, because I’m a sicko, so referring to the instructions and flopping the components around with the game’s janky physics was a treat. I love Building Relationships. I want to build more relationships, and also more Ikea furniture. You can wishlist it now on Steam. As the new arrival to the island, you're here to meet eligible bachelorx pads and find the love of your life! Enjoy a one-of-a-kind story as you navigate a bizarre dating adventure amongst a unique set of structures. Uncover hidden secrets! A variety of biomes across an island, jam-packed with goodies!

    "content": "Developer Zockrates Laboratories UG • Publisher Phiphen Games • Release April 2025 • Platforms PS, Xbox, Switch, PC Platformers usually ask players “How can you overcome this obstacle?”. Ruffy and the Riverside changes the question by asking “What if you could change the obstacle itself?” Its unique texture-swapping mechanic offers an eyebrow-raising answer. After sitting down with the game’s Steam demo, I walked away largely impressed with this promising twist on the 3D platformers of yesteryear. Ruffy is a cheery bear plastered with a smile wide enough for a plane to fly through. His real talent is the magical power to copy textures – grass, water, or sand, for example – and paste them onto a different surface. Copying and pasting climbing vines onto a waterfall turns it into a climbable surface. Toying with this feature becomes fun in an instant. I once copied sand and pasted it onto a river, turning it into a flowing path of quicksand. I know it’s quicksand because I eagerly jumped in and sank to my death. While good for platforming, clever traversal puzzles use texture-swapping to its fullest. To scale a series of tall stone columns standing in the middle of an ocean, I needed to make them lower to jump atop them. First, I copied a wood texture and applied it to the columns’ bottom stacks. Next, I copied a lava texture from a nearby erupting volcano and slapped it on the water. With the ocean now a molten sea, the columns’ now wooden foundations burned into ashes, causing them to sink low enough for me to leap on. The game shines brightest when it encourages this type of out-of-the-box thinking. Whether it’s changing a wall painting’s pattern to unlock a key or rearranging tiles to solve a riddle, I’m impressed with the different puzzle variations presented so far. However, my enthusiasm to swap anything and everything was dampened by the fact that only certain textures can be applied to specific objects. The game told me “no” more often than I expected or wanted, which was a bit of a bummer. Ruffy falls into the collect-a-thon genre of 3D platformers ala Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie. A main overworld features small challenges that reward stars; collecting enough unlocks platforming levels laden with them. The platforming stages are pretty textbook; texture swapping spices up the otherwise routine jumping around. That doesn’t mean that’s all players will do. I had a good time in one stage that ditched platforming in favor of what’s essentially a skateboard competition, except Ruffy rides atop a giant ball of hay. Developer Zockrates Labs has something special in Ruffy and the Riverside‘s main hook. It’s a novel way to interact with the world, and I’m excited to see how puzzle-solving evolves throughout the full adventure. The platforming feels good, and I dig the Paper Mario-esque art direction; every character looks like a vibrant marker drawing cut out of a notebook. If all goes well, we may be pasting Ruffy and the Riverside on the list of indie gems for 2025.",

    "content": "Developer YCJY Games • Publisher YCJY Games • Release February 6 • Reviewed On PC Is it possible to feel nostalgia for a zeitgeist you never experienced — that may never have really existed at all? Though Keep Driving is thoroughly European, the road trip is a venerated concept in car-centric American culture. Route 66, drive-ins, and the silver screen all harken back to a time when the open road meant freedom. While I didn’t live through any of this in its heyday (and considering it has come down to me via advertisements and media with particular motives for painting the pavement like a picturesque scene the reality is questionable) there’s still a piece of me ready for that promised adventure. Keep Driving taps into the road trip fantasy and delivers a game where the journey truly is the destination. It’s not all carefree, with a host of problems from stubborn sheep to potholes to contend with, but the unique sense of choice, replayability, and branching narrative manifest the promise in its title. I can’t stop driving. It’s not listed among the game’s various genre tags, but Keep Driving most closely resembles a rogue-lite. Though its other listed categories (including Adventure, Simulation, and RPG), are also key pillars. A “run” — though in this game it might be more thematic to call it a drive — begins at home. I step out of my house as a teenager with a free summer, the open road, and a letter in front of me. Inside the envelope is an invitation to a music festival clear across the map. Looking over my beat-up sedan, I wonder if the thing will actually hold up over so long a distance. It won’t be long until my poor wheels are tested. The gameplay consists of two parts: Braving a stretch of plotted-out highway and recovering in an automobile oasis before setting out again. While on the road, a variety of events await. Most of them will test my car, body, and wallet. One of the first hurdles I have to navigate is a slow-moving truck. The difficulties aren’t played out in real-time action, rather they are represented by various icons on your dash. Little green figures indicate an impending threat to your stamina. Blue dots are a challenge to your vehicle’s stability. And there are icons for things like money and gas as well. In a turn-based battle for good vibes, I have to use skills that correspond to the correct threat, neutralizing it. If I’ve used up all my skills or just haven’t unlocked the proper one to combat a particular danger, I take a hit. If the damaging threat was a gas icon, my actual gas gauge ticks down. Now, I have that much less in my tank to take me to the next stop on my map. If I completely run out of gas — or my car’s durability drops to zero, or my body’s energy depletes, etc. — I face the realistic consequences. Several times throughout my four-hour first run, I found myself stranded on the highway. The game offers tenuous lifelines to get back on track. If I have money or energy left, I may be able to sacrifice them to get back to my last checkpoint. However, my most harrowing brush with defeat made me resort to calling my parents for help — something which, for me, had only about a forty percent chance of working out. The road also offers introspection and friendships. As I zoom along, I get to thinking about life’s larger problems, like whether I could down an entire bottle of liquor and still be good to drive. Or whether nature holds inspiration or dread. In the first case, my confidence resulted in a bottle appearing in my trunk (I sold it for some quick cash at the first convenience store I came across). My favorable view of the forest, however, changed my stats, giving me a buff when cruising through wooded areas. Sometimes, I was hailed by someone in need on the side of the road. The characters had a wide range of backgrounds, goals, and skill sets. The first hitchhiker I picked up was a punk rocker with a dog hoping to make it to a major town for a show. This gave me a new side quest which enriched my experience. His back-and-forth dialogue about the nature of humanity filled the hours as the scenery flew by. He and his canine companion also helpfully lent me their skills during road events, noticeably changing up my combat strategy. All of these combined meant that — even though I was essentially doing the same thing — no stretch of road ever felt the same. Unique rewards, thoughts, and challenges accompanied each. The urge to see what waited just around the next bend makes the game extremely hard to put down. Then there’s phase two: The stops. Successfully arriving at my next destination meant gaining experience for what I’d overcome, a chance to stretch my legs, and resupply. My experience points allow me to unlock increasingly useful combinations of skills from my skill tree. It also threw some tricky planning at me, as I often didn’t have enough money to completely refuel, fix my battered car, soothe my aching body, and grab snacks or helpful items for my next adventure. Often in Keep Driving, I would pour what resources I had into fueling my next leg of the trip before taking off again, hoping for good luck on the road. Keeping everything running smoothly could be a stressful pursuit, but the unpredictable events, hazardous challenges, and stimulating connections kept my hands firmly on the steering wheel.",

    "content": "Developer Soft Not Weak • Publisher Soft Not Weak • Release February 3 • Played On PC Match-3 games, when done right, excel at lulling players into a zen-like state of puzzle-swapping bliss. Spirit Swap: Lofi Beats to Match-3 To captures nirvana and layers on a lofi soundtrack, charming visuals, and a comforting vibe to its action. Though the package is sparse with a narrative element that doesn’t grab me, the core gameplay should attract anyone who uses puzzle games to decompress and zone out. Fans of the SNES cult classic Panel de Pon, perhaps better known in the West as Tetris Attack, should feel right at home in Spirit Swap. Unlike traditional Tetris, players can only swap two tiles horizontally to line up three matching symbols to clear them from the ever-rising board. Hanging tiles can also strategically plummet into open spaces below. Thanks to Panel de Pon’s arrival to Nintendo Switch Online, I became a big (and late) fan, so I was eager to try Spirit Swap’s modernized spin on the formula. Spirit Swap plays identically to Panel De Pon but adds fun wrinkles in the form of board-clearing spells. These special powers activate depending on how tiles are arranged. A matching 2×2 square-shaped pattern can clear several topmost rows. A cross shape can clear all tiles within each of its cardinal directions. Equipping up to three spells at a time from a growing pool of them adds a thoughtful preamble to starting a round, and they’re obtained by completing the game’s story campaign. I don’t need a narrative hook to enjoy a good Match-3 game, and Spirit Swap’s charming but flat tale doesn’t change my mind. As the witch Samar, you’ll stop invading spirits by playing competitive best-of-three puzzle battles against her fantastical (and beautifully illustrated) friend circle while lending an ear to their personal plights. Whether it’s comforting Samar’s BFF after a breakup or cultivating a romance with a cool skater boi, spending time with folks raises Samar’s bond with them. Deepend relationships reward new spells and a small selection of new decor, such as plushies or a froggy rug, to jazz up her customizable bedroom. It’s the lightest take on systems like Persona’s Social Links and Animal Crossing’s Happy Home Designer. Combined with a thin narrative, the campaign feels more like a garnish to the core gameplay than a meaningful destination. I’m not the biggest home decor guy, and Samar and Co. seem lovely, but I wanted to skip through their dialogue to jump quickly to the next round of puzzle swapping. Perhaps that’s a testament to the strength of the versus matches, where players swap furiously while sabotaging each other by sending obstructing trash blocks. As such, most of my time with Spriit Swap has been spent testing my skills in its Endless Mode. I swapped my heart’s content under various settings, such as adjusting the tile speed and overall difficulty. I appreciate how these options allow Spriit Swap to be as relaxed or intense as players prefer. Spirit Swap nails its relaxing vibe as effectively as its match-3 gameplay. The vibrant art direction makes it easy on the eyes while its enjoyable lofi soundtrack calms the nerves. Perhaps the best compliment I can give is I’ve already burned through a couple of podcasts while lining up its whimsical tiles. When I’m looking to ease my nerves with a good puzzler, I’m happy that Spirit Swap will have my back.",

    "content": "Developer Jump Over The Age • Publisher Fellow Traveller • Release January 31 • Reviewed On PC “Because you are a broken thing, and you have nothing left but that brokenness, and the beauty that shines through it.” Two hundred and forty-three cycles after my desperate, amnesiac escape, I wait for it all to end. To end, and, hopefully, begin anew. Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector is a masterwork. Starting at the end seems fitting for this sequel, which is rife with musings on the nature of time — perhaps inspired directly by Citizen Sleeper 2’s place as the end of the franchise. At the title’s conclusion, I, the player, become the Sleeper — the game’s humanly hero — brilliantly. Turning off the game after the credits roll is like putting myself in suspended animation with the looming possibility of a new adventure. If I’m not too afraid to succumb to hope, I myself can mimic the protagonist’s journey. Injecting real life with a game’s reality, influencing me to experience the character’s doubts as I decide whether to start over from scratch or hold on to my lived memories, is a gift few developers can give. As for the journey itself, Citizen Sleeper 2 is a tabletop role-playing game made virtual. Six-sided dice control my success or failure for almost every action. This includes everything from discovering where in town to buy supplies to whether I earn a day’s wage or even whether I can navigate danger unscathed. Every scenario plays out via the most skillfully and subtly woven descriptions draping embellishments across the screen. The text conjures the smallest details of a gesture and the vastness of the cosmic landscape in my mind without needing to picture it on screen. The writing, simply put, is phenomenal. Successfully punching my way through a tough spot or gliding out of peril on the tip of my silver tongue depends on my stats, and, more broadly, which class I picked at the beginning of the game. An operator’s skill, for example, is tailored for interfacing but has absolutely no aptitude for endurance. This can be a problem when I face an obstacle that demands brute strength and leaves me at the mercy of the dice. But even in the best circumstances, things can always go bad. Unlike the previous title, Citizen Sleeper 2 encourages me to gather a rag-tag crew on my spaceship, which I can bring out with me on various celestial missions. So, I quickly move to recruit a character with a little brawn. It seems like my problems are solved after that, but the game throws another curveball at me: Stress. Stress accrues out in the vast reaches of space when skill checks go awry. When my crew members get overwhelmed, they dip out of the mission, dramatically cutting down my chance at success. With each stress level I gained, I increased the chance that one of my five D6s would break — that’s right, completely shatter and become useless for the foreseeable future. I might also find myself glitch-infested, transforming one of my dice. After glitching, that die would only have a twenty percent chance of success no matter what. You have to be desperate to use them, and I definitely got desperate before the end. With these new elements, the sequel offers more movement, strategy, connection, and risk. Committing to a course, contending with corroded edges and struggling to survive, is exhilarating. Failure is unavoidable, but reality’s harshness makes the moments of empathy and humanity glimmer brighter. Mechanically, the game is great at spurring pressure, inducing movement, and prompting carefulness. The clock is always ticking. I’m constantly being hunted, and staying on one planet too long ensures capture. There never seems to be enough fuel, cyro (currency), or supplies to flee comfortably. It doesn’t help that every locale harbors people in need, tempting opportunities, and waylaying plot points. However, the tension is doled out in meticulously measured doses. Whatever the outcome, it’s never so harsh that I want to quit. Sometimes – most times – things simply don’t work out the way I anticipated and there are very few easy choices. Everything involves strings, compromises, and uncertainties. But choosing to do the best with what I have feels more like a badge of honor than a failing. Succeeding feels like a triumph. Citizen Sleeper 2 is phenomenal, evocative, and haunting. The minimal visuals are flawlessly supported by the writing. Gut-wrenching expressions and touchingly lonely scenes flow out of the masterful descriptions. The audio design had me rocketing from dawning dread to heart-pumping motivation. And in the end, I was forced into the hero’s dilemma in a way that cemented this game as one of the year’s best.",

    "content": "Developer Yellow Brick Games • Publisher Yellow Brick Games • Release January 28 • Played On PC An Ashpeak Drake is attacking, and Brynn needs to get to higher ground. An incoming fireball shakes the tower, shattering crates and a bookshelf leaning against its stone walls. The wooden staircase is missing a flight, so Brynn uses magic to construct a crude bridge of ice to close the gap. Finally, she reaches the building’s summit and is greeted by the night sky and the glare of a snarling, draconic beast. As it rears back to unleash another blast of fire, Brynn uses the last of her magic to crust the creature’s wings with ice. As it spirals to the earth below, she leaps onto its back, slashing at it the whole way down. This isn’t the description of a cutscene, quick-time event, or scripted boss fight – it’s an organic encounter I had with an enemy just a few hours into Eternal Strands. Its thoughtfully crafted physics systems and magic abilities make for a dynamic world that’s fun and complex, even in the earliest hours. Eternal Strands is the debut title from Yellow Brick Games, an independent developer founded by a team of AAA veterans, including people who worked on beloved series like Dragon Age and Assassin’s Creed. Their first project is a third-person action title that stars Brynn, a magic-wielding adventurer exploring the ruins of an enchanting world. The titular Strands are the source of Brynn’s magic. Each one allows her to interact with the world in fantastical ways, and you’re encouraged to use them liberally. You start with two: Weaver’s Grasp and Ice Wall. The former is essentially The Force – you can pick up most enemies and objects and toss them around dealing significant damage and clearing paths. Meanwhile, Ice Wall generates clusters of ice wherever you point, allowing you to draw shapes to put out fires or freeze enemies in place. These tools are incredibly intuitive in ways video games don’t always account for. Ice Wall, for instance, can obviously create walls of ice, but it can also freeze body parts of huge enemies, either keeping them stuck in place or temporarily disabling certain limbs. Freezing the wings of a Drake causes it to struggle to fly and crash to the ground. Freezing the foot of a giant ark, a magical colossus, keeps it stationary for long enough to climb on its back. Climbing is not limited to combat – Eternal Strands allows players to climb on virtually any vertical surface. Brynn is limited by her stamina meter, but it’s very generous at the game’s opening, and I rarely lacked the stamina to get where I wanted to go. The world is broken up into a series of open areas the player can travel between, so while the story is linear, the player is encouraged to explore. Between the climbing system and magical traversal techniques, that exploration feels great. Brynn defends herself with an array of weapons in combat, including a sword and shield, a bow, and a large two-handed blade that she can switch between on the fly. Combat feels good, complete with parries, dodge rolls, and a stamina meter, but you’ll almost always need to complement sword swings with spells. Many enemies automatically dodge arrows, so you need an Ice Wall to keep them in one spot. It’s also often more useful to throw one enemy into another with Weaver’s Grasp since it knocks both to the ground and gives Brynn room to breathe. I love this design choice; it makes combat cinematic and exciting while clearly distinguishing it from other fantasy-themed action titles. Brynn’s equipment, including armor, can be forged and improved through the game’s crafting systems, which I returned to frequently. Between monster drops and destructible items in the environment, you can collect a wide variety of materials, and they’re sorted into a handful of wide categories. For example, “carved resources” include wood and some types of stone, while “forged resources” encompasses ores and metals. Instead of calling for specific materials, a crafting recipe only requires items from the category; instead of asking for five pieces of iron, it just needs five pieces of any forged resource. The specific resources affect the appearance and the stats, so a bow made with softwood is weaker and lighter in color than a bow made with ironwood. This ultimately means you can craft virtually any item as soon as you get the recipe. But you’re also heavily rewarded for exploring the world to get specific resources to customize the gear to your preferred colors and stats. I spent a good amount of my playtime hunting around for green materials (my favorite color), but a more strategic player may hunt for items that would make their armor resistant to cold or fire damage. Eternal Stands’ combat encounters and resource collection occur on expeditions Brynn can embark on three times a day. Between these trips, she spends time back at the home base with the rest of her adventuring crew. While I find the supporting characters at least a little endearing, the story itself is not particularly interesting. Between a general lack of conflict between characters, the absence of a specific antagonist, and dialogue laden with exposition and proper nouns, I relied on the gameplay loop to keep me invested, not the story. This might change later in the game, but not in the first four hours. That said, I am engaged with the storytelling in Eternal Stands, but it’s the story of my adventures exploring the world. When you give a player an exciting toolbox and drop them in environments designed to react to those tools in multitudes of ways, it creates countless unique, organic stories, like the perilous Ashpeak Drake encounter I recounted at the top of this piece. I can’t wait to hear other players’ stories when they get their hands on this game, and I can’t wait to dive back in to make more of my own.",

    "content": "Developer The Game Kitchen • Publisher Tripwire Presents • Release January 28 • Played On PC My mind is split in two — which thematically works pretty well for The Stone of Madness, the new game from the creators behind the Blasphemous franchise. Its animated cutscenes manifest movement and personality, harkening back to works like Dragon’s Liar or The Sword in the Stone. However, the irresistible style is, unsurprisingly from The Game Kitchen, shaded quite a bit darker here. The gameplay loop also looks back in time for its genre: Strategic stealth, which I’ve long been a fan of and have seen increasingly fewer examples. I’m perfectly content to lurk in the shadows clocking patrol routines and plotting out possible infiltration routes. It is intensely hard to put down even before weighing in the pull of the historical setting and clandestine plot. So why am I of two minds if the gameplay is absorbing and the worldbuilding is captivating? It’s almost like two unrelated teams worked on each part and at no point communicated with the other. The bizarre stitching of two aspects has left me baffled, though I still find the game hard to put down. I’ve put eight hours into The Stone of Madness so far. Honestly, I suspect I’ll finish it, partly because it’s an excellent Steam Deck experience and podcast game. It does have a day/night cycle, but time isn’t an enemy. Rather it’s a currency I spend to gather knowledge before enacting — what I hope is — my perfectly laid plans. For those who may not be familiar with the game, I wrote a preview you can check out. As a quick summary, players control a group of deeply flawed inmates in an eighteenth-century monastery’s insanity ward. Indeed, each individual has their struggles, including an unmanageable fear of fire or the dark, which makes my tasks even more difficult. However, they also boast essential skills, like lockpicking or spellweaving. This merry band comes together after the mysterious death of a fellow inmate, revealing a conspiracy surrounding a supernatural stone. I played out finding this woman and discovering the stone over a three-hour prologue. During that time I had tutorials, like you’d expect, and built up my team’s synergies and resources. In the end, I was given a choice that promised to drastically change the game’s narrative path. What it also drastically changed was my opinion. After picking my path, the game seemed to have started all over again in a way. The tutorials came back as if I’d never seen them, all of my hard-earned loot was inexplicably gone, and the narrative became unignorably disjointed. The opening cutscene made it seem as though I had, in the past, collected a crew and brought them all into my base. Even after the prologue, though, it still seemed like my teammates hadn’t officially joined in my cause and I still had to get everyone together. It was like the narrative and gameplay were there, it was just no one had a vision for melding the two coherently. Confused, I moved on seeking to unravel the mystery at The Stone of Madness‘ heart. The inconsistencies have yet to resolve themselves, but the gameplay and world maintain their iron grip on me even hours later. Maybe the game’s dazzling disparate pieces will blend as I reach its conclusion. At least I hope, lest I join the characters in their disoriented prison.",

    "content": "Developer Odd Bug Studio • Publisher United Label • Janurary 28 • Reviewed On PC With smoke from the war — replete with losses, twists, and triumphs — still hanging in the air, I was excited to head back into Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter‘s world. The exploration, level design, and discoverable rewards are the game’s highest gameplay peaks. The difficulty is I spent so much time in the game’s lowest gameplay valleys. The combination of limited saving and battles that demand a little more than the controls allow is a frustrating blow to my soul. A beautiful medieval, hand-drawn fantasy cataloging the intrigues of the Ratdom, Tails of Iron 2 begins with a royal bastard and undead nightmares awakening. The narrative pulls me from comfortable sheets to the destruction of all I’ve ever known. I feel the weight of unexpected responsibility. I’m unprepared and unequipped to rebuild my crumbled world, but my burning rage pushes me to revenge. It’s undeniably intriguing that Tails of Iron 2’s combat requires brain as much as brawn. Enemies’ color-coded moves indicate whether I should dodge, parry, or shield to survive the onslaught unscathed. When it all comes together, I feel wildly skilled — like I fought through fire and emerged tempered steel. Unfortunately, these mechanics require just a little more than the controls allow. The movement doesn’t flow like a Dead Cells or Nine Sols, it’s much more weighted. This means dodging is uncertain, parry timing isn’t precise, and the shield takes a fraction too long to rise to my defense. The frustrations compound with the game’s antiquated saving. Namely, there’s no autosave. This culminated in what, for me, was one of the most maddening gaming moments I’ve experienced in recent memory. Having taken on a harsh, two-phase boss battle multiple times, I slowly mastered the timing for each of my foe’s moves. Even then – with tools like exploding traps, element-based magic, and damaging-increasing whetstones – it was a bitter battle to snatch an eventual victory. Out of healing and with only a sliver of health to my name, I rescue a captured cohort of rodents before heading back to the save point located in the next room over. Unfortunately, a series of elevated ramps separated me from this goal and, before reaching the save, I slipped off one. The damage from falling ten feet was enough to wipe the rest of my health. I respawned with all my hard work undone, with the boss waiting for me once more. I saw red. I cursed. I thought of never playing again. But, to give credit to the devs, they offer a great tool to keep me from flinging the game away at this moment. As a saving grace, I can go into the settings at any moment to change the difficulty level, which I immediately did. The sad thing about the lower difficulty is it robs combat of its unique strategy, reducing it to a smash-fest which is often over too quickly. In this case, it was worth it, but I grieved the loss of the intriguing back-and-forth elements. I also felt upset that the ingredients were all here for a combat system I would have adored, but it just doesn’t come together. Refusing to be overshadowed, the world is so worth pushing through the frustration to revel in. Every level offers a unique and complex biome with a buffet of side quests, hunting opportunities, resources, and joyful traversal. Though the main story leads me through each realm, often to recruit a personality-filled member of the court I was rebuilding from ashes, there’s so much to see and do besides this. One of my favorite off-the-beaten-path treats is the intricately designed equipment sets – a mind-boggling array of which will never be seen by the player. Each set offers its own elemental buffs, damage defense, or attack stats which could be the difference between victory and defeat. The effort that went into these is impressive – as are the characters and world-building that support the environments they lie in. It’s disappointing how often Tails of Iron 2 leads me to wander the darkened valleys of over-demanding combat and back-track-demanding save points. However, the view from the mountain summits – the game’s secret-filled levels, propelling narrative, and magical visuals – cast sunlight on even my hardest experiences.",

    "content": "Developer Ivy Road • Publisher Annapurna Interactive • Release March 11 • Platforms PS, PC The recent news of Eathblade’s cancelation brought another anticipated indie game to my mind. A game that is, in part, a response to the pressures of creating a follow-up title in the wake of a previous release’s unbelievable popularity. One that also touched me personally, as I was playing it over the winter break — a time I probably should have been relaxing rather than working. Wanderstop examines what we do to ourselves when we push too hard for too long — when the pressure collapses down on us. It’s a gentle probe and a harsh warning. Both feel authentic and empathetic, perhaps because the game’s director Davey Wreden has been there with us before. The Stanley Parable creator has made no secret of his struggles with burnout, and that they directly influenced the themes in his upcoming project. Despite its cozy facade, don’t go in unprepared for Wanderstop’s intensity. I stare at the screen for a moment, unbalanced. Wanderstop — a game I expected to kick off with a warm cup of tea — instead thrust me into a brutal, beautiful, and darker narrative world than I’d anticipated. In mere moments, the game peeled back the layers of a strong, unbeatable warrior, Alta, jolting her vulnerable nerves. Burnout, overworking, obsession with perfection, and throwing mental health to the wayside, all of these flash wildly across the screen, across the heroine’s face. She thinks it’s all been worth it. Until she fails. My thoughts were pounding in the aftermath. The art style transformed from the soft stylistic signature of a cozy game to slashes of hand-drawn sketches and back again. The dialogue punched me in the gut. Like the main character, I needed a second to catch my breath. She decides to take a journey to her old mentor to regain her skills, and I’m along for the ride. She never makes it through the woods. Walking the tree-lined path, the physical and mental weight of my sword becomes too much. It falls from my hand. Soon, I can’t even support my own body and drop to the beaten earth as my legs fail. Enter Boro. A hulking figure of a man, Boro seems like he should be more familiar with combat than tea. He sits next to me gently as I wake, convincing me to recover in his shop rather than push on. I finally gained control of the character and my first act, instead of using my limited demo time wisely to further the main quest, was to rush over to a gaggle of penguin-like creatures I’d spied across the yard. It seemed like a fitting act considering the game’s themes. Pluffins, as the creatures turned out to be, are adorable and offer me the chance to pet and carry them around. From this moment on, you have to imagine everything I’m doing in the demo is done with a Pluffin either in my arms or very nearby. Making tea is a serious and multi-stepped pursuit that starts with farming. Though the idea is common in games of this genre, Wanderstop’s approach is novel. My seeds thrive or transform depending on what pattern I place them in, owing to a touch of magic. I spent a lot of time trying out different arrangements and combinations just to see what would happen — something Davey Wreden was happy to watch me do after quickly check-in, making sure I wasn’t just confused. I enjoyed my time in the garden a little too long, which meant the deeper intricacies of tea making — like figuring out how the whimsical rollercoaster delivery system worked or testing out what the stories-tall glass cauldron did — was lost to me. But it won’t be long until I can dive deeper since Wanderstop is set to release in March, and I can’t wait.",
