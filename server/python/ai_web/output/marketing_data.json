    "content": "Customer Service in 2020: A customer’s billing issue lands in the queue. 2025: That same billing hiccup gets spotted. Efficiency like this is the future of customer service. While quick fixes are great, challenges like delayed responses, agent burnout, language barriers, and scalability issues remind us that there’s still room for improvement. That’s where a well-designed chatbot can make a real difference. Implementing a chatbot is a strategic move — but the key lies in asking the right questions: Let’s get you those answers. But first things first. A customer service chatbot is a software tool designed to address customer inquiries and resolve issues through automated conversations. It leverages databases to retrieve information, uses customer history to gather context, and tailors contextual responses. These chatbots operate across various platforms, including websites, mobile applications, messaging services like WhatsApp, and social media channels. When unable to resolve an issue, they efficiently escalate the matter to the appropriate human agent. Let’s talk about the benefits AI chatbots bring to customer support. Look past the basic chatbot features. A support tool that doesn’t have these seven features will cost your players and burn out your team. Traditional support forces players to leave their game and describe technical issues they barely understand. The consequence? Endless back-and-forth, wrong diagnoses, and players giving up entirely (AKA rage-quitting). Modern in-game support changes this by directly pulling error logs, device data, and game states. Your team can push fixes, reset features, or trigger tutorials without players leaving their session. Look past basic help content. A customer service chatbot needs a unified help center that merges knowledge bases with live support. Your team can integrate FAQs, support articles, and conduct searches for customers to solve issues with AI chatbots without bouncing between platforms. When users need solutions, they can find them through instant articles or switch to agent chat without leaving their screen. AI tracks what resources work and what needs improvement. When you cut those resolution times, you’ll watch the satisfaction scores rise. Only 25% of internet users speak English natively. Global games need global support. Customer service chatbots with multilingual capabilities meet players in their own language and handle regional slang and cultural contexts. Your Brazilian players get the same quality support as your English players. The system learns from every interaction and gets better at regional gaming slang and local issue patterns. Look at any support team’s tickets: most questions get asked over and over. Smart support automation handles these common issues instantly. The system performs smart issue classification, routes complex problems to specialists, sends auto-updates on ticket status, and resolves simple queries using AI-powered answers without agent help. This frees up your team to tackle unique problems that need a human touch. Context gets lost when support is fragmented across email, chat, and social. A player can start troubleshooting on Twitter, continue in-game, and finish via email. Real omnichannel systems keep the entire conversation history connected. Your team sees every interaction, from in-game messages to social posts. Players pick up their support thread anywhere, anytime. Better still, this helps build a consistent brand presence. Most support tools work in isolation. Without switching between tools, they can’t see player stats, purchase history, or game progress. You can fix this through APIs. Your chatbot creates integrations with CRM systems, pulls live game data, and checks the performances of agents, bots, FAQs, and support teams. Your developers also get the freedom to build custom solutions for unique game mechanics. Look at this simple integration: One line of code [Helpshift.showFAQs(Activity a, Map<String, Object> configMap)] adds complete support features to your app. Players tap ‘Help,’ get instant FAQ access, and can start a support chat if needed. When agents reply, players see a notification right in the app. Most games track surface metrics: solved tickets and response times. Smart analytics dig into CSAT scores, resolution speed, and support volume trends. You can slice this data by game platform, support agent, language, or custom tags. This means spotting bottlenecks fast, like which games need more Japanese speakers or when your weekend team is overwhelmed. These insights help fix problems at the source.

    "content": "In B2B customer service, every interaction matters to the bottom line. One missed alert can impact business relationships and revenue. Top-performing companies understand this and turn their customer service from reactive helpdesks into partnership hubs. And they’re seeing the results — stronger relationships, lower ticket resolution times, and more stable gaming experiences for everyone. The gameplay behind the support is simple: Effective CS service tool × Simplified integration = Scalable support success Check out how companies implement outstanding customer service. B2B customer service refers to all interactions between a business-to-business (B2B) company and its customers. It begins with the sales journey and continues throughout the customer journey, such as contract renewals or purchases. B2B customers depend on their service providers. When you provide support to other businesses (platform providers, payment processors, or server hosts), you protect revenue through retention, enhanced player experiences, and business partnerships. For example, in gaming, a support ticket rarely means a simple fix. It means understanding enterprise contracts, meeting service-level agreements, and protecting business interests on both sides. Speaking of which — there’s a fundamental shift in how B2C support operates compared to customer service B2B. Say, server instability hits during peak hours at a major gaming company. Two support teams spring into action — one handling individual player complaints, the other managing enterprise gaming partners. Team A responds to the player frustrated about lag in their favorite battle royale game. The customer service representative checks the connection, walks through basic troubleshooting, and resolves the issue in 15 minutes. Success metrics: Player satisfaction and quick resolution. Team B tackles an urgent call from a platform partner hosting 50,000 active players. The support team assembles technical leads, checks SLA commitments, and coordinates with multiple stakeholders. Every minute of downtime costs real revenue. Success metrics: Partnership health and business continuity. Now, look at the key differences between the two gaming support models: B2C customer service focuses on end consumers with simple one-to-one interactions, often automated and omnichannel, including social media, email, and chat. Transactions are high in volume but low in value, with feedback centered on user experience and features. In contrast, B2B customer service caters to businesses, involving complex interactions across departments and multiple stakeholders. It emphasizes personalized support through formal channels like email, phone, and in-person meetings managed by dedicated account teams. B2B transactions are fewer but higher in value, with feedback focusing on customization and technical support. While B2C SLAs are less formal, B2B SLAs are well-defined and supported by detailed product training for agents. To cope with the high stakes in B2B and win customers’ trust, customer service must be defined at the front end. Here is the list of 15 examples specially designed for B2B. Support teams fielding repetitive queries face a critical choice: hire more agents or work smarter. But, 73% of users prioritize quick answers over human interaction. Advanced FAQ automation shows how working smarter wins. Quick-search bots scan user queries, matching them with relevant solutions from the knowledge base. Here, the tech doesn’t replace human support — it enhances it. When automated answers don’t solve the issue, conversations thereby transition to support specialists who also understand the context. Time-based automation adds an extra layer of efficiency, automating SLA tracking across open tickets. When an agent hasn’t sent their first response or a user hasn’t replied, automatic triggers kick in. It frees your support teams from manual SLA tracking and lets them focus on solving complex integration issues. The system also handles follow-ups, monitors response gaps, and maintains compliance without constant human oversight. Your partners can rest easy knowing their urgent issues get immediate attention at any hour of the day. Keeping players in the game while resolving issues has proved an effective tactic in gaming customer service. Sybo recently improved its support strategy by integrating SDK-based messaging directly into its game interface. As a result, support time dropped 86%, while customer satisfaction scores jumped from 3.8 to 4.3. Now, players never leave their gaming session to get help. Support teams track real-time engagement, spot emerging issues, and protect revenue streams. For B2B gaming partners, this translates to stronger player retention and more stable communities. Imagine a support ticket arriving at 3 AM with minimal details about an in-game payment issue. Instead of keeping customers waiting in queue, a custom bot launches into action, performing five key diagnostic steps. It pulls error logs, checks backend systems through API connections, asks targeted questions about transaction IDs, platform details, and error messages, and maps the impact across player sessions. Within minutes, it gathers critical data that would’ve taken an agent multiple back-and-forth exchanges. By the time a specialist picks up the case, they have everything needed to dive straight into solving the problem. When a mobile gaming studio receives a flurry of partner tickets, it doesn’t always have to be clear and crisp. But Smart Intents recognize different phrases expressing the same problem — whether a player writes “payment gateway down” or “transaction failures mounting.” No ticket gets lost in translation, and no player waits while support figures out who should handle their case. Payment issues reach the financial integration specialists, while server issues route to the infrastructure team. The best part is the system grows smarter with each interaction, catching the subtle differences between integration issues, payment problems, and server alerts. With Language AI, companies targeting global customers stay front and center as multi-language support spans all corners. Huuuge‘s gaming support team faced a bottleneck recently: players from 195 countries but not enough multilingual agents. But they took swift actions — sought the help of Language AI and ditched the clunky process of switching tabs and copy-pasting translations. Now, English-speaking agents help Russian, Chinese, and Japanese players directly in their native languages. Support flows 24/7 across 36 languages; no specialized language agents are needed. Response times dropped 21%, while player satisfaction jumped, especially in the Asian markets. Support managers have to address certain blind spots regularly: Which agents excel? Do FAQs actually help users? Are response times impacting satisfaction? Traditional metrics tell half-stories, leaving leaders guessing about team effectiveness. A central analytics hub can be your best bet here. It These insights let you refine customer service strategies based on what actually works, not what you think might work. Players hate leaving their game to hunt for answers. Also, your support team hates answering the same questions repeatedly. Digital self-service fixes both problems. Convert those repetitive queries into crisp FAQs, add troubleshooting tools, and watch your players solve problems independently. Bytro Labs proved this works: they tackled 17,000 monthly tickets with just 2.5 agents. Issues needing human touch only reached the team, and the rest were tackled by a self-service knowledge base – the foundation, not an afterthought. Fragmented email threads and slow response times are the best ways to annoy players (and your agents). In a similar situation, switching from email to a modern messaging-based support system changed everything for Jam City. Players now get instant responses without leaving their game, while support teams handle multiple conversations efficiently with the full context of each player’s history. Their ticket volume dropped 30% while customer satisfaction doubled. The real-time messaging system also provided valuable insights into recurring issues. Adapting to modern customer service enhancement meets not only the demand of customers but also the overall quality of customer service. Your support agents burn out when ticket volumes increase and resolution time suffers. But with task automation, the agent saves time(and energy) When you automate a task, operations continue without interruptions as support platforms automatically tag tickets, route them to the right specialists, and send instant acknowledgments to customers. When simple issues come in, they’re resolved automatically with helpful responses. After preset timeframes, tickets update their status without manual intervention. Thus, issues that require human expertise (only) are aligned with agents. Coordination between teams is a serious gap that needs to be addressed. Support managers can’t effectively track agent workload when critical player issues involve multiple departments, and your developers miss insights about recurring problems. A unified analytics dashboard solves this. You get real-time visibility across teams, track your support queues, measure agent performance, and evaluate self-help effectiveness all in one place. Your teams can also monitor essential KPIs and customer sentiment instantly. Let’s say a customer reports a server glitch in a critical match, but your support team is swamped. Handling it becomes haywire now. But then, If you have an AI chatbot, it deciphers the issue using natural language processing (NLP), identifies it as a server problem, and provides an immediate workaround from your approved content. But, if the issue is too complex, the bot routes it to a specialist with all the necessary context. Ultimately, your players stay in the game, your CSAT scores improve, and your reputation stays intact. Fragmented interactions can create chaos for your team, especially when agents switch between Facebook, Discord, and WhatsApp conversations. Here, a multichannel communication system is key to bringing teams together for collective collaboration. By unifying messaging from multiple channels; your team can access complete conversation histories in one place where everyone stays on the same page. Whether messaging, phone calls, or self-service options, your team can work together like never before. There is no guesswork when it comes to customer service effectiveness. The feedback bots engage customers right after resolution through purposeful conversation steps. Through focused check-ins, it sees if customers got what they needed, gathers insights about their experience, and catches anyone still stuck. This way, routine follow-ups become opportunities to improve player support and strengthen service quality through real player insights. Console players hit a wall when errors pop up. Controller typing turns a simple support request into a tedious ordeal. QR codes placed on error screens or packaging provide instant mobile access to support. Players can scan to join discussions, access FAQs, or connect with the community all through phones. It helps keep players with quick navigation for resolution without having to juggle across menus to connect with the right experts. You save your customer time and also a headache ^_^ The B2B customer service examples we’ve explored show how modern support tools transform reactive helpdesks into strategic assets. Helpshift brings these capabilities together: Your gaming partnerships carry high stakes — every support interaction impacts thousands of players and real revenue.

Instead, conversational artificial intelligence solves customer problems instantly, with a pop-up appearing in the right-hand corner of the screen. Conversational AI for customer service reduces response times from hours to seconds and slashes operational costs by half. Let’s see how. Conversational AI for customer service is an advanced support technology that automates interactions through Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). Unlike basic chatbots with rigid scripts, It provides faster support by reading context, delivering relevant solutions, and engaging in human-like conversations. It recognizes speech and text inputs, comprehends intent, mimics human language, and provides multilingual support. For business leaders, it impacts two metrics: Unlike the age-old rule-based chatbots, modern conversational AI learns (with every conversation) to improve response accuracy and relevance. “The use of AI in customer service is a great example of how AI and humans can work together. Training AI to understand language, determine intent, and triage problems through well-defined workflows helps offload the grunt work from the agents, allowing them to focus on problem-solving, creative solutions, and empathy for the customer.” – Erik Ashby, Senior Director and Head of Product at Helpshift. Technical terms won’t solve support tickets. Your customers need solutions in their language at their convenience. For that, the following components of conversational AI need to work together. NLP decodes customer messages like a support agent who speaks multiple languages. When players write “can’t connect,” “connection error,” or “game offline,” NLP recognizes these variations as network issues. It spots problem types, urgency levels, and key details that help deliver the right solutions. Like a support lead who remembers every customer interaction, Dialog Manager tracks your conversation’s progress. It knows which solutions you’ve tried, what worked, what didn’t, and what to try next. When you say “that didn’t work,” it remembers which fix you attempted and moves on to better options. NLG turns raw data into clear support messages. After understanding your customer’s problem and deciding how to help, NLG crafts the response. For example, when detecting a server connection problem, rather than displaying “Network_Error_0x8007”, NLG creates readable responses: “We see you’re offline. First, check if your WiFi is connected, then try logging in again.” These components work together to build good conversational AI customer service. But most support solutions promise automation, but few deliver real results. The difference lies in training. AI must learn from millions of customer conversations to understand and solve problems. For example, Helpshift built its AI models by training the machine using billions of support interactions. The system automatically connects customers to knowledge base articles that may solve their problems before you have to get a human agent involved. It offers a self-serve experience and in-chat instructions based on customer intent. This smart workload distribution helps your agents reduce response times and increase customer satisfaction score (CSAT). Now, let’s put all of this into context. Say there’s a gaming support issue; here’s how the conversational AI works, from receiving the user query to delivering the solution. When players message support, the system receives their text requests. A player having trouble with in-game purchases might write: “Bought 1000 gems but didn’t get them. Order ID #GEM789.” The system takes in this raw message. NLP digs into what the player needs. Our example identifies this as a missing purchase issue. It picks up details: the purchase amount (1000 gems), the problem (items not received), and the order reference (ID #GEM789). It understands this isn’t a gameplay issue or connection problem but a transaction concern. Players phrase the same problem differently: NLP recognizes these variations point to the same issue. The dialog manager makes sure we have every detail needed to help. For this missing gems ticket, it checks: It asks specific questions if crucial information is missing: “Could you confirm the email address linked to your purchase? This helps us track your transaction faster.” This step turns raw data into clear updates. Instead of: TRANSACTION_STATUS: COMPLETED DELIVERY_STATUS: PENDING DELAY_TIME: 5_MIN It creates messages in customers’ language like: “Your payment for 1000 gems has been confirmed. Due to high server traffic, there’s a 5-minute delay in delivery. Your gems will appear automatically; there is no need to restart the game.” It’s the final step that delivers this response to the player in their chat window with clear information about their purchase status. All this happens in seconds, and player concern now becomes reassurance. Conversational AI is an asset for your customer service teams. Here are seven reasons why. Improve agent efficiency as your team spends less time on repetitive questions about order status, account access, or basic troubleshooting. Conversational AI handles 3.5x more tickets without adding headcount. This means your existing team can manage higher ticket volumes without getting overwhelmed or compromising on quality. Break down language barriers in customer support without hiring multilingual teams. Multilingual customer support accurately detects and responds in customers’ preferred languages to maintain consistent service quality across regions. Enter new markets confidently and serve diverse customer bases with standardized support processes. Ensure customers get help whenever they need it, even outside business hours. Conversational AI provides round-the-clock first-level support with common queries and urgent issues immediately. Your customers don’t have to wait for the next business day to get basic problems solved. Conversational AI for customer service helps your teams track which issues come up most frequently, identify emerging problems, and understand where customers get stuck. With such analytics and solid data, you improve self-service resources, refine product features, and train your team on what matters most to customers. Meet customers on their preferred platforms: email, messaging, or in-app support. An omnichannel support system promises consistent service quality across all channels. Your team maintains context across interactions by avoiding repetitive customer questions. Scale customer support as your business expands. Handle increasing support volumes without proportional team expansion. Your support system adapts to growth spikes during product launches or seasonal peaks. Customers who receive fast, relevant solutions are more likely to make repeat purchases and recommend your business to others. You’ll also see higher CSAT scores when customers get instant, accurate answers. So, no customer frustration; it only builds trust. Let’s look at the types of conversational AI for customer support that makes these benefits possible. Now, look at how top companies use conversational AI to solve business challenges. Banking: Bank of America’s virtual assistant Erica helps 1 billion customers annually to manage their money better. It sends timely alerts about unusual charges, suggests smart spending habits, and teaches practical money skills. Most importantly, it catches potential fraud before customers lose money. Retail: Sephora shows how personalized support drives sales and loyalty. Their Virtual Artist helps customers try makeup virtually and find perfect products. Shoppers book store appointments, check product availability, and even identify makeup from celebrity photos. Human Resources: HR teams use support conversations to find great talent faster. Take Hewlett Packard: their hiring system matches candidate skills with perfect job openings. In early 2023, website visits doubled to 950,000, with 26% of visitors becoming HP employees. The system handles initial screening while HR focuses on choosing the best cultural fit. Gaming: Studios handle massive support volumes during launches and tournaments. Huuuge‘s success story shows how instant problem-solving keeps players happy. When millions log in simultaneously, automated systems tackle connection issues and purchase problems across languages and time zones. Marketing: Mountain Dew’s DEWbot connected with gamers during their “Rig Up” Twitch series, earning a Short Award nomination. Support messages evolved into genuine fan engagement, proving that solving problems builds lasting customer relationships. Every support crisis begins with a moment of truth. For gaming companies, it’s often launch day. For eCommerce, it’s a holiday rush. Moments like these define customer loyalty, and you have a smart conversational AI strategy in place. We’ll show you how to implement one. If your customer, Laura, is troubleshooting a connection issue during an online tournament at midnight, she needs a solution right now in clear and simple terms. A “We’ll get back to you soon” message is the last thing she wants to see. To create an effective AI strategy, analyze what your customers frequently ask. Use existing support data to map the most common problems and pinpoint pain points. Ask questions like: For every query, design workflows that address the issue fully. For example, when Laura reports a “server connection error,” the conversation should not end with “server connection error.” Instead, it should follow up with next steps: “Your connection is unstable. Try switching to a wired connection or closing background apps. If the issue persists, we’re here to help.” Test these flows repeatedly with real customer scenarios to make sure they’re seamless. Introducing AI shouldn’t disrupt your existing processes. Instead, integrate it into tools your team already uses. For instance, Helpshift’s conversational AI plugs directly into customer service platforms, reducing setup hassle. A quick tip: Start small. Automate FAQs or repetitive tickets before scaling to complex interactions. Your team is key to conversational AI success. Equip your agents with training on how AI works and how it assists. For example, when Laura escalates her issue, the agent should see the AI’s previous interactions and step in when needed. Agents become more confident and skilled in managing AI-assisted workflows with regular training. Every conversation is a learning opportunity. Use AI to track patterns in customer concerns and improve over time. For instance, if many customers like Laura report lag during peak hours, flag this as a process improvement area. Regularly update your AI with these learnings to keep it evolving alongside your customers’ needs. Running a support team?

    "content": "Marketing an indie game is a crucial aspect of the game development process, often determining the game's success or failure in a highly competitive market. This article delves into the various channels available for promoting indie games, guiding developers on how to effectively utilize them to reach their audience and build a loyal fan base. Indie game marketing is not just about promoting a product; it's about creating an engaging story around the game and its developers. This includes establishing a brand identity, interacting with potential players, and cultivating a community. The narrative woven around the game can be as compelling as the gameplay itself, drawing players into the world the developers have created. This storytelling aspect can manifest through various channels, such as behind-the-scenes videos, developer blogs, and social media updates that share the journey of game development, including the challenges and triumphs faced along the way. Successful marketing strategies require a thorough understanding of your target audience. This involves identifying who your players are, what platforms they frequent, and what kind of content resonates with them. By aligning marketing efforts with the preferences of your audience, you can more effectively capture their interest and encourage them to try your game. Engaging with players through surveys or beta testing can provide invaluable insights, allowing developers to tailor their messaging and promotional content to better meet audience expectations and desires. In the indie game landscape, marketing can often be the difference between obscurity and success. Unlike established studios with large budgets, indie developers must rely on creative marketing strategies and grassroots efforts to promote their games. This often means leveraging social media platforms, engaging with gaming influencers, and participating in gaming events or conventions to showcase their work. By building relationships with content creators and streamers, indie developers can tap into existing audiences and gain credibility through authentic endorsements. Effective marketing helps indie games gain visibility, attract players, and generate buzz prior to and following a release. It can also contribute to long-term success through community building, encouraging ongoing engagement and support from fans. A strong community can lead to word-of-mouth marketing, which is invaluable for indie games. Developers can foster this sense of community by actively participating in forums, hosting live Q&A sessions, and creating spaces for players to share their experiences and feedback, thus nurturing a loyal fanbase that feels invested in the game's success. Despite the importance of marketing, indie developers face several challenges. Limited budgets mean fewer resources for advertising and promotion, making it essential to prioritize organic reach and community engagement. Many indie developers find themselves wearing multiple hats, often juggling game design and marketing responsibilities, which can stretch their time and energy thin. This multifaceted approach requires not only creativity but also a willingness to learn and adapt to new marketing techniques and platforms. Additionally, the saturated gaming market can make it difficult for indie games to stand out. Developers must also navigate the rapidly changing landscape of social media and marketing trends, which can quickly evolve and affect visibility strategies. Staying updated with the latest trends, such as the rise of TikTok for game promotion or the importance of short-form video content, is crucial. Furthermore, understanding the algorithms that govern these platforms can help indie developers optimize their content for better reach and engagement, ensuring their games don’t get lost in the noise of countless releases. Social media has forever changed the way indie games are marketed. From sharing game updates to engaging with fans, these platforms provide invaluable opportunities for developers. Each platform offers unique advantages, allowing developers to cater their content accordingly. Focusing on the right social media channels can significantly boost an indie game's outreach and engagement. Let’s explore the key platforms that can be leveraged for marketing purposes. Facebook allows indie developers to tap into vast user demographics. It's a great platform for creating a community around your game and hosting events, such as livestreams or Q&A sessions. Developers can create dedicated pages for their games, post updates, and engage with followers. Additionally, Facebook Ads can be targeted to specific audiences, making it an effective tool for reaching potential players. Twitter has transformed into a lively hub for indie developers to share their progress and connect directly with their audience. The brevity of the platform encourages quick updates and interaction. Using relevant hashtags, developers can reach beyond their existing followers and tap into conversations around indie gaming, game jams, and other relevant topics, facilitating organic growth in visibility and engagement. For indie games with compelling visuals, Instagram is the ideal platform for promotion. The app's focus on imagery allows developers to showcase art, screenshots, and gameplay in an engaging format. Moreover, Instagram stories and reels provide opportunities for developers to share behind-the-scenes content, fostering a connection with followers and potential players. Engaging aesthetics can significantly enhance interest and excitement around the game. Engagement in gaming communities and forums is a powerful method for promoting indie games. These spaces allow developers to connect with passionate players and industry peers, gaining insights and feedback about their games. Choosing the right platforms to interact with communities can significantly impact the game's visibility and reputation. Here are a few platforms where indie games can thrive. Reddit hosts numerous communities dedicated to gaming, including several specifically for indie games. Subreddits such as r/indiegames provide a space for sharing game updates, receiving feedback, and building excitement ahead of release. Developers need to engage with the community genuinely—by participating in discussions and contributing valuable content rather than solely promoting their games, which can lead to a more positive response from Reddit users. Being present on the Steam Community is critical for any indie developer planning to release their game on the platform. It's an excellent ecosystem for engaging with players through discussions, updates, and events. Developers can utilize Steam's features to share news, respond to community queries, and create an area for fan discussions. This interaction adds to the game's visibility and builds a loyal following. IndieDB is a dedicated platform for indie games, offering developers a place to showcase their projects. Here, developers can share updates, news, and even beta versions to gather feedback. Using sites like IndieDB can help indie developers cultivate a following while simultaneously gaining exposure to a wider audience interested in indie titles. Engaging in user discussions and responding to feedback is vital for maximizing this platform's potential. Email remains one of the most effective marketing tools available, allowing developers to communicate directly with their audience without the interference of algorithms. Building an email list can lead to increased engagement from loyal supporters. The effectiveness of email marketing lies in its ability to deliver personalized content and announcements straight to subscribers’ inboxes. Here's how to get started. To build a strong email list, developers should create incentives for potential subscribers, such as exclusive content, promotional discounts, or early access to game demos. This exchange encourages visitors to join the mailing list. Promoting the email sign-up through social media, the game’s website, and during community events can help grow the list significantly, ensuring that the developer has an engaged audience to communicate with upon launch. Engaging email content is key to keeping subscribers interested. This can include game updates, developer insights, and upcoming events or promotions. Use eye-catching visuals and compelling calls-to-action to solicit direct responses from your audience. By consistently providing value in your emails, you can maintain engagement levels and build anticipation for your game’s release. Influencer marketing has emerged as a powerful strategy for indie developers looking to extend their reach. Collaborating with popular streamers and content creators can give your game exposure to a larger audience. It’s essential to approach influencer marketing thoughtfully, ensuring that the chosen influencers align well with your game and target demographic. When searching for influencers, consider their audience engagement, content style, and relevance to your game genre. Collaboration with influencers who have a genuine interest in indie games will likely result in a more authentic promotion. Analyzing engagement metrics can also provide insight into whether an influencer’s audience would resonate with your game, ensuring an effective partnership. Working with streamers and YouTubers can create invaluable exposure through gameplay showcases and reviews. Hosting playtesting sessions or providing early access copies can encourage these influencers to share their gameplay experiences. Fostering a genuine relationship with influencers is crucial for long-term success. Regular interactions can lead to collaborative content, increasing the potential for viral marketing. In conclusion, successful indie game marketing involves leveraging a combination of social media, community engagement, email marketing, and influencer partnerships. By understanding the nuances of each channel and actively connecting with players, developers can significantly enhance their game's visibility and success in the competitive gaming market.

    "content": "This article is based on Dave Steer’s enlightening talk at the Product Marketing Summit, hosted by our sister community, Product Marketing Alliance. Let’s talk about something that’s probably on everyone’s mind right now: AI and its impact on our roles. First, a little intro. I’m Dave, and I lead the brand and product marketing team at GitLab. In case you’re unfamiliar with it, GitLab is what we call a DevSecOps platform. Essentially, it brings developers, security teams, and operations together in one place so they can collaborate at scale and ship better, more secure software faster. Today, we’re diving into a topic that’s connected to what we do at GitLab but extends far beyond it. It’s a conversation about AI – both the promise and the pitfalls. This isn’t about cheerleading for AI adoption or sounding the alarm about its risks. It’s about holding both perspectives at the same time. We’ll explore current trends, look at new data, and discuss practical use cases. By the end of this, I promise you’ll walk away with actionable tips for experimenting with AI at work. Let me start with two “aha” moments I’ve had with AI in the past year. You know those moments when the light bulb goes off, and you suddenly see both the potential and the challenges of something? The first moment ties back to GitLab. Over the past two years, my team and I have been working on bringing what we call GitLab Duo to market. GitLab Duo is essentially our suite of AI tools integrated across the software development lifecycle, giving engineers end-to-end workflows powered by AI. The “aha” for me was this: if we’re doing this for engineers, why aren’t we doing it for product marketers too? Think about it – what if we could integrate AI into every part of our workflows? There’s a lot of potential there, but it also requires careful thought. My second “aha” moment happened when I learned sales negotiation skills from AI. Here’s the story: about a year ago, when AI hype was at its peak, I came across a site called More Useful Things. It’s run by a Wharton professor who teaches MBA concepts like sales negotiation and case studies using AI. The resource library includes a set of prompts anyone can use. One of them caught my eye: a role-playing scenario where the AI acts as both mentor and customer. The idea is to practice selling by interacting with the AI as if it were your buyer. I decided to tweak the prompt. I set the stage as if I were a GitLab seller pitching our DevSecOps platform to a C-level executive. Within minutes, I was deep into a back-and-forth roleplay with the AI. Here’s what blew my mind: the AI wasn’t just playing along. It stress-tested my discovery questions, even though I’m the one who writes them. It challenged my objection-handling techniques. At one point, it even paused the scenario and said, “Hey, Dave, here’s something you could improve.” Imagine that – a robot teaching me about my own messaging and positioning. And it was right! That experience hooked me instantly. My big takeaway? AI is going to change everything. It’s not just a tool; it’s a game-changer for how we learn, work, and refine our craft. If you’ve ever wondered whether AI will affect your job, here’s the spoiler: AI is going to impact all of our jobs. Wharton’s research examining over 1,000 professions revealed that only 3.5% of them don’t overlap with AI capabilities. Professions like dancing and bricklaying might seem safe, but even those are subject to AI’s influence – think about how dance coaches or construction project managers could integrate AI into their roles. So, the real question isn’t “Will AI impact my job?” but “How will AI impact my job?” For product marketers specifically, it’s worth considering how our roles will evolve and how we can use AI to eliminate mundane tasks and focus on strategic opportunities. AI isn’t the first assistive technology to transform the way we work. Look back at how power tools revolutionized carpentry – they didn’t eliminate carpenters; they made them more efficient, enabling them to tackle more ambitious projects. Similarly, spreadsheets didn’t replace accountants; they freed them up to focus on complex, strategic financial decisions. Digital cameras didn’t eliminate photographers; they encouraged creativity and experimentation by removing the need to develop film. The same is true for product marketing. AI isn’t going to replace product marketers – but it will push us to rethink what parts of our jobs can be automated so we can spend more time on strategic, high-impact work. Here’s the good news: almost all of us are already using AI. In a recent survey I conducted in partnership with Product Marketing Alliance, an astounding 96% of marketers said they’re currently using AI tools in their roles. Even more interesting, 60% of respondents only started using AI in the past year, and 83% plan to increase their use of AI in the next 12 months. In short, we’re all fairly new to this, but we’re diving in headfirst. And the data suggests we’re pushing through the traditional hype cycle faster than ever. While this isn’t an official Gartner hype cycle, it’s a useful framework to understand where we stand with AI. The “innovation trigger” kicked off just a couple of years ago with the launch of ChatGPT. Almost overnight, every company seemed to claim they were “powered by AI,” and the hype hit its peak. But now, we’re moving past inflated expectations and transitioning into the “slope of enlightenment.” This is where careful testing of use cases leads to meaningful integration, eventually bringing us to the “plateau of productivity.” Another study by McKinsey highlights that AI is being adopted across more business functions than ever before. Nearly half of companies report using AI in two or more functions, with sales and marketing leading the way. For product marketing teams, this means we’re at the forefront of AI adoption – collaborating with sales to innovate, experiment, and define best practices. AI isn’t just a passing trend; it’s here to stay, and it’s reshaping how we work for the better. So, what’s behind the rapid adoption of AI? Why are we all jumping on board? While there are several reasons, I believe one key factor is that AI is helping address one of the biggest challenges product marketers face: the product marketing ratio problem. If you’re a product marketer, you’ve probably felt this – the delicate balance between the number of product marketers (PMMs) and product managers (PMs). Get the ratio right, and you can achieve work-life balance while delivering a big impact. Get it wrong, and you’re constantly playing catch-up. But what is the “right” ratio? A study of the top 100 software companies looked at the top-performing quartile and found the ideal ratio was one PMM for every 1.6 PMs. Now, be honest – is the ratio of PMMs to PMs even close to that at your company? Yeah, that’s what I thought. Product marketing is a critical, strategic function, but too often we’re stuck playing catch-up. That means we risk being seen internally as what my friend Liza Adams calls the “master of the battlecard” or the “creator of the customer deck.” These are important deliverables, but they’re not the essence of what we do as product marketers. Here’s the good news: AI has the potential to transform us into what I call the 10x PMM.",

    "content": "Algorithms have become ubiquitous, influencing nearly every decision-making process in our daily lives—from job applications to mortgage approvals. Despite their efficiency and consistency, one pressing question remains: how do consumers feel about decisions made by robots (bots) versus humans? Recent research reveals a surprising twist: while unfavorable decisions (e.g., rejections) elicit similar consumer reactions regardless of the source, favorable decisions (e.g., acceptances) spark notably less enthusiasm when made by an algorithm than by a human. This insight challenges assumptions many managers and marketers hold, and it underscores the need for a nuanced approach to integrating algorithms into consumer-facing interactions. As a Top Product Marketing Voice, with years of experience driving revenue growth (+124% U.S. revenue growth) and improving customer retention (+31% retention boost), I’ve seen firsthand how understanding consumer sentiment can make or break a product strategy. Let’s explore key takeaways from this research and how marketers can address the human-bot tension effectively. Help shape the State of Developer Adoption 2025 Report that we're building together with Instruqt. Share your insights and spotlight the top tactics for driving developer adoption of your products. 🕐 Just 4 mins. Big impact. At its core, the difference in consumer reactions to algorithmic and human decisions lies in attribution. When receiving favorable decisions from a human, consumers tend to internalize the outcome, interpreting it as a reflection of their unique value or worth. This personal validation fosters stronger emotional connections. On the other hand, favorable decisions delivered by algorithms often feel transactional. Consumers struggle to ascribe the same personal meaning, leading to a muted positive response. In the case of unfavorable decisions, however, consumers react similarly to both algorithms and humans. Rejections are often externalized—blamed on biases, flawed criteria, or systemic issues—regardless of who or what delivers the news. Marketers increasingly rely on algorithms for decision-making at scale, but this research highlights the importance of humanizing these processes. Drawing from my experience leading global product marketing initiatives, here are three actionable strategies: Since consumers respond less positively to algorithmic acceptances, marketers should focus on making these interactions feel personal and empathetic. Simple adjustments to messaging can bridge the emotional gap. Instead of: “Approved by our system.” “Congratulations! After carefully reviewing your application, we’re excited to share this decision with you.” Even automated messages can adopt a tone that mimics human interaction. Alternatively, hybrid models, where algorithms handle evaluations but humans communicate results, can boost consumer satisfaction. Case in action: During my tenure at one company, we leveraged AI to analyze client needs but paired it with personal outreach from our team. This dual approach contributed to our 90% global revenue growth, ensuring clients felt valued beyond the data. Consumers externalize unfavorable decisions, so marketers can mitigate negative emotions by emphasizing objective criteria and offering actionable next steps. Transparency about the process makes rejection feel less like a personal failure. “Based on current eligibility criteria, we cannot approve your request at this time. We encourage you to reapply once these factors improve.” Providing constructive feedback or alternatives, such as resources for improvement, shifts the narrative from rejection to opportunity. Case in action: At Amazon, our team tackled user churn by introducing personalized improvement recommendations based on behavioral data. This approach didn’t just soften the blow of cancellations—it drove a 31% improvement in customer retention. A lack of understanding often fuels consumer skepticism toward algorithmic decisions. By demystifying how algorithms work, companies can build trust and reduce negative reactions. For instance, a fintech app could explain: “Our algorithm uses industry-leading data models to analyze your profile and provide decisions tailored to your unique circumstances. Here’s how it works...” Transparency instills confidence, making it easier for consumers to accept decisions—whether favorable or not. Case in action: During my time at TomTom, we introduced user-friendly dashboards to explain how our navigation algorithms optimized routes. This increased user trust, contributing to over $40 million in incremental sales from new services. One striking finding from the research was the disconnect between managers’ predictions and consumer reactions. Managers often overestimate how positively consumers will respond to algorithmic decisions, particularly favorable ones. To close this gap, managers need to adopt a more consumer-centric mindset. Here’s how: As AI adoption accelerates, the solution isn’t to choose between humans and bots but to integrate both in ways that maximize their strengths. Algorithms offer unparalleled efficiency and consistency, while humans bring empathy and emotional intelligence to the table. Imagine a healthcare scenario where an algorithm diagnoses a patient with precision, but a doctor delivers the results with compassion and discusses the treatment plan. This balance ensures both accuracy and emotional support. For product marketers, the same principle applies. Whether it’s a subscription service, SaaS product, or fintech app, the winning strategy lies in pairing data-driven decision-making with human-centric communication. The findings on consumer reactions to algorithmic versus human decisions offer profound lessons for product marketers. Here’s what we can take away: As someone who’s worked on both sides of the equation—leveraging cutting-edge algorithms and crafting empathetic marketing strategies—I’ve seen the transformative impact of balancing efficiency with humanity. The question isn’t whether consumers will interact with algorithms—they already do. The real question is how marketers can design these interactions to resonate emotionally and drive lasting loyalty. By understanding the nuances of consumer reactions and implementing strategies that humanize algorithmic successes, depersonalize rejections, and build trust through education, product marketers can thrive in this hybrid world. As I reflect on my journey—from driving $40M in new revenue streams at TomTom to creating award-winning retention strategies at Amazon—one truth stands out: technology may be the engine, but empathy is the fuel. The future of product marketing lies in finding harmony between the bot and the human. Let’s embrace it. It only takes 4 mins to shape developer adoption.

    "content": "Hey, did you know that top engineering leaders believe that \"business alignment\" is their top challenge? If you think marketing to them is just like marketing to developers, let me stop you right there. These are the people juggling strategy, team morale, and technical challenges while keeping the C-suite happy. And trust me, your buzzwords aren’t cutting it. If your pitch is all hype and no substance, they’ll ignore it faster than you can say “seamless integration.” Why? Because engineering leaders don’t care about fluff. They’re practical, skeptical, and ridiculously busy. To really connect with them, you’ve got to step into their shoes. It’s not just about knowing what they do, it’s about understanding how they think. Picture an engineering leader juggling three critical meetings, a code review, a product roadmap discussion, and a budget justification to the CFO, all in one day. Their world is a constant balancing act, requiring both technical precision and business acumen. Let’s break it down. Engineering leaders are the translators between engineering teams and the C-suite. They switch between two gears: If your marketing only speaks to one of these modes, you’re missing half the picture. Great engineering leaders are also people managers. They’re hyper-aware of burnout, team morale, and individual productivity. If your product doesn’t reduce late nights or make onboarding easier, it’s a non-starter. Every decision they make is under scrutiny: Your product doesn’t just need to work, it needs to help them justify their choices to both sides. Developers care about how something works. Engineering leaders care about why it matters. They’re asking questions like: If you’re just listing features or talking about ease of use, you’re missing the bigger picture. Engineering leaders have a radar for BS. If your pitch is full of buzzwords like “next-gen disruption” or “paradigm shift” and feels too polished, they’ll assume you’re hiding something. They prefer clear, straightforward language that focuses on tangible outcomes. They prefer raw, unfiltered demos and honest answers over flashy presentations. They’re not looking for tools that do “cool things.” They need solutions to specific headaches, like: If you’re not addressing these pain points, you’re wasting their time. Before you start writing copy, put yourself in their shoes. What’s stressing them out? What’s keeping them awake at night? If you can’t answer these questions, you’re not ready to market to them yet. Engineering leaders prioritize a few things: Let’s get practical. These strategies work because they tap into what engineering leaders deal with every day, from balancing tricky tech decisions with business goals to keeping their teams running smoothly. These people don’t trust easily, especially not marketers. Build credibility by: Let’s skip the fluff and get to the good stuff. These types of content work because they’re packed with practical knowledge and real takeaways, things engineering leaders can actually use to tackle their daily challenges. Engineering leaders aren’t hanging out in random corners of the internet. Meet them where they already are: If you want to market to engineering leaders, stop thinking like a marketer and start thinking like them. They don’t care about flashy campaigns or vague promises. They care about real solutions to real problems. Show them you understand their world, give them proof your product can help, and speak to them like a human, not a sales deck. And remember, their challenges are constantly evolving, so your strategies should too. Continuously seek feedback, monitor trends, and adapt your approach to stay relevant. Get this right, and you won’t just earn their attention, you’ll earn their respect. And that’s what turns marketing into real results.
